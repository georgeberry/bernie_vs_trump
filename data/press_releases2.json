{"url": "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-for-president-inc.-oped-the-culture-of-life", "text": "Let me be clear\u2014I am pro-life. I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me. My story is well documented, so I will not retell it here. However, what I will do with the remaining space is express my feelings about life, and the culture of life, as we approach the 43nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade.I build things. There is a process involved in building things. We tap into a lot of disciplines with engineering being one of the most important. The rules for putting structures together are as strict as are the rules of physics. These rules have stood the test of time and have become the path to putting together structures that endure and are beautiful. America, when it is at its best, follows a set of rules that have worked since our founding. One of those rules is that we, as Americans, revere life and have done so since our Founders made it the first, and most important, of our \u201cunalienable\u201d rights.Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of country. They are missing, and they are missed.The Supreme Court in 1973 based their decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found. Even if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress. Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best.If using taxpayer money to facilitate our slide to a culture of death was not enough, the 1973 decision became a landmark decision demonstrating the utter contempt the court had for federalism and the 10th Amendment. Roe v. Wade gave the court an excuse to dismantle the decisions of state legislatures and the votes of the people. This is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision. Perhaps Roe v. Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government.We are in the middle of a presidential political cycle and votes will be cast in just days. The citizens of this nation will have the chance to vote for candidates that are aligned with their individual worldviews. It is my hope that they will choose the builder, the man who has the ability to imagine the greatness of this nation. The next President must follow those principles that work best and that reinforce the reverence Americans hold for life. A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness. It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again.\u00a0", "author": "Trump"}

He is the single biggest liar I\u2019ve ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them. His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous. It is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much.\n\n\nCruz said I would be appointing a liberal judge when in fact I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far, at the debate, as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William \u201cBill\u201d Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes.\n\n\nCruz says I am pro-choice, when in fact I am staunchly pro-life and have been for a long time. Like Ronald Reagan, on many issues, I have evolved.\n\n\nCruz says I am in favor of ObamaCare, when in fact I have spoken about repealing and replacing this disaster of a system at every speech throughout my campaign and since it\u2019s inception. Meanwhile, Cruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against ObamaCare twice.\n\n\nCruz says I will try to take away your second amendment rights, when I am one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms and I say so in every speech that I have made for years. I am a proud member of the NRA and so are my sons.\n\n\nCruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign.\n\n\nIn Iowa, Cruz told thousands of Ben Carson voters that Dr. Carson had left the race and to instead vote for Ted Cruz. He apologized when the race was over. Likewise, his fraudulent voter violation form sent to Iowa voters. If Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation, I have no choice but to fight back.\n\n\nOne of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President. If he doesn\u2019t take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately. Additionally, the RNC should intervene and if they don\u2019t they are in default of their pledge to me.\n\n\nI am the strongest on the borders and I will build a wall, and it will be a real wall. I am strongest on illegal immigration, strongest on ISIS, strongest on the military and I will take care of our Vets. I will end common core and preserve the second amendment. I will renegotiate our trade deals and bring our jobs back to our country. I am the only person who will Make America Great Again.\u00a0\n\n", "author": "Trump"}

He was getting ready to go to college on a football scholarship and his sole fault was walking home to see his father. Because of the relationship I have established with his father, Jamiel\u2019s death is very personal to me. We must stop illegal immigration.\u201d\n\n\nJamiel Shaw added, \u201cDonald Trump is the only person fighting to put American families first. He will protect our children and put an end to these senseless acts of violence that are caused by our failed policies and broken immigration system. Donald Trump has made it clear he, like most Americans, wants to return the rule of law to the people of this country. Without strong borders we don\u2019t have a country. Strong border enforcement is the first step to preventing future tragedies. We must secure our borders and return those who came here illegally to their native lands.

I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me. My story is well documented, so I will not retell it here. However, what I will do with the remaining space is express my feelings about life, and the culture of life, as we approach the 43nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade.I build things. There is a process involved in building things. We tap into a lot of disciplines with engineering being one of the most important. The rules for putting structures together are as strict as are the rules of physics. These rules have stood the test of time and have become the path to putting together structures that endure and are beautiful. America, when it is at its best, follows a set of rules that have worked since our founding. One of those rules is that we, as Americans, revere life and have done so since our Founders made it the first, and most important, of our \u201cunalienable\u201d rights.Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of country. They are missing, and they are missed.The Supreme Court in 1973 based their decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found. Even if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress. Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best.If using taxpayer money to facilitate our slide to a culture of death was not enough, the 1973 decision became a landmark decision demonstrating the utter contempt the court had for federalism and the 10th Amendment. Roe v. Wade gave the court an excuse to dismantle the decisions of state legislatures and the votes of the people. This is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision. Perhaps Roe v. Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government.We are in the middle of a presidential political cycle and votes will be cast in just days. The citizens of this nation will have the chance to vote for candidates that are aligned with their individual worldviews. It is my hope that they will choose the builder, the man who has the ability to imagine the greatness of this nation. The next President must follow those principles that work best and that reinforce the reverence Americans hold for life. A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness. It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again.\u00a0", "author": "Trump"}

He is the single biggest liar I\u2019ve ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them. His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous. It is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much.\n\n\nCruz said I would be appointing a liberal judge when in fact I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far, at the debate, as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William \u201cBill\u201d Pryor Jr. and Diane Sykes.\n\n\nCruz says I am pro-choice, when in fact I am staunchly pro-life and have been for a long time. Like Ronald Reagan, on many issues, I have evolved.\n\n\nCruz says I am in favor of ObamaCare, when in fact I have spoken about repealing and replacing this disaster of a system at every speech throughout my campaign and since it\u2019s inception. Meanwhile, Cruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against ObamaCare twice.\n\n\nCruz says I will try to take away your second amendment rights, when I am one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms and I say so in every speech that I have made for years. I am a proud member of the NRA and so are my sons.\n\n\nCruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign.\n\n\nIn Iowa, Cruz told thousands of Ben Carson voters that Dr. Carson had left the race and to instead vote for Ted Cruz. He apologized when the race was over. Likewise, his fraudulent voter violation form sent to Iowa voters. If Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation, I have no choice but to fight back.\n\n\nOne of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President. If he doesn\u2019t take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately. Additionally, the RNC should intervene and if they don\u2019t they are in default of their pledge to me.\n\n\nI am the strongest on the borders and I will build a wall, and it will be a real wall. I am strongest on illegal immigration, strongest on ISIS, strongest on the military and I will take care of our Vets. I will end common core and preserve the second amendment. I will renegotiate our trade deals and bring our jobs back to our country. I am the only person who will Make America Great Again.\u00a0\n\n", "author": "Trump"}

FOX News is making tens of millions of dollars on debates, and setting ratings records (the highest in history), where as in previous years they were low-rated afterthoughts. \n\nUnlike the very stupid, highly incompetent people running our country into the ground, Mr. Trump knows when to walk away. Roger Ailes and FOX News think they can toy with him, but Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t play games. There have already been six debates, and according to all online debate polls including Drudge, Slate, Time Magazine, and many others, Mr. Trump has won all of them, in particular the last one. Whereas\u00a0he has always been a job creator and not a debater, he nevertheless truly enjoys the debating process\u00a0- and it has been very good for him, both in polls and popularity. \n\nHe will not be participating in the FOX News debate and will instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for the Veterans and Wounded Warriors, who have been treated so horribly by our all talk, no action politicians. Like running for office as an extremely successful person, this takes guts and it is the kind of\u00a0mentality our country needs in order to Make America Great Again.\n", "author": "Trump"}

Bernie Sanders on Monday laid out key differences with Hillary Clinton in their contest for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.\u201cPeople need to know the difference between hastily-adopted campaign rhetoric and the real record and long-held ideas of the candidates,\u201d Sanders said during a news conference at a labor union hall. He spelled out differences with Clinton on trade policy and talked about the difference between his people-powered campaign and her Wall Street-bankrolled Super PAC.He called for overturning the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United. The disastrous 2010 decision led to creation of super PACs, like Clinton\u2019s Priorities USA, which take unlimited sums from millionaires and billionaires. There is what Sanders called \u201ca very profound difference\u201d between his campaign \u2013 funded by more than 4 million individual donations averaging $27 apiece \u2013 and Clinton\u2019s super PAC, which in the last half of 2015 raised $25 million from powerful special interests including $15 million from Wall Street.\u201cNow I know that every candidate who has ever received special-interest money always says that the millions of dollars they receive will never influence them. Never, never, never. Well, Americans need to ask a simple question. If these contributions from powerful special interests have no influence over the candidates, why are they making huge campaign contributions?\u201d Sanders asked.On trade, Sanders welcomed Clinton\u2019s new-found resistance to a proposed Pacific Rim trade deal but noted that she was sympathetic to it in the past and favored other bad trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. The trade pacts promoted by multi-national corporations have contributed to the shutdown of 60,000 U.S. factories and resulted in the loss of good-paying jobs in the United States. While Clinton may have shifted stands recently, Sanders noted that Thomas Donahue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, predicted she would do another about-face and support the business-backed deal if she wins the White House.At the same news conference, Sanders was endorsed by People\u2019s Politics, a grassroots group that fights for racial and economic justice.\u201cI hold many identities within me,\u201d Maria Elena Letona, executive director of Neighbor to Neighbor Massachusetts Action, said. \u201cI am an Afro-Latina, immigrant, woman. Like me, no one in our country is simply one thing. The crisis we face today is complex. We need a leader who won\u2019t separate economic inequality from the fight to end racism. We need a leader who represents us as a whole people. The promise of Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign is that the political revolution is big enough for all of us.\u201dThe members of People\u2019s Politics endorsing Sanders today include Neighbor to Neighbor Massachusetts Action, Maine People\u2019s Alliance, Vocal-N.Y. Action Fund, Community Voices Heard Power of New York and SouthWest Organizing Project Action of New Mexico. Several members of People\u2019s Politics, The Reclaim Campaign/The People\u2019s Lobby of Illinois, Rights and Democracy of Vermont and New Hampshire and Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Action, have already endorsed Sanders bid for the White House.Sanders flew to Massachusetts for the news conference here and a rally in Amherst after campaigning in South Carolina, where Democrats vote on Saturday.

Only 2.3 percent of Sanders\u2019 total money raised comes from maxed-out donors. With far fewer total donors, Clinton has tapped out more than 23,000 of her donors who have given to her campaign committee all that the law allows for the primary election and may donate no more. Her maxed-out donors provided nearly 60 percent of the primary money raised for her campaign committee.Another way to gauge support is to examine donations of $200 or more, the legal threshold for which donations must be itemized in FEC reports. In Clinton\u2019s case, 83 percent of her money came from donors who gave more than $200. In contrast, only 26 percent of the money raised for Sanders came from donors above the $200 threshold.Tallying contributions from small donors is another yardstick that campaign finance analysts examine. Sanders reported more than $23.4 million in fourth quarter donations of less than $200. That\u2019s out of a total $33.6 million raised in the last quarter of the year. Despite an aggressive online campaign designed to jack up the number of her small donors, Clinton\u2019s total take for her campaign committee in the last three months of 2015 in un-itemized donations totaled only $5.7 million of her more than $38 million total haul for the quarter.Sanders\u2019 small-dollar donors continue to be the financial backbone of his campaign. Last month alone, nearly $21 million was donated to him. The money came in the form of 812,012 separate contributions averaging only $26 apiece. That brought the total number of donations since Sanders launched his campaign last April 30 to more than 3.3 million, a record for any presidential candidate at that point in a campaign.Clinton has been criticized for her heavy reliance on donations from Wall Street and other special interests. For example, she left the campaign trail in Iowa one day last week to hold a fundraiser in Philadelphia sponsored by leading executives of a large investment firm. And The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the super PAC backing Clinton amassed $15 million of the $25 million it raised in the second half of last year from Wall Street sources.To read Sanders\u2019 FEC report, click here.", "author": "Bernie"}

That\u2019s a record at this point in the campaign for any White House candidate.Unlike other campaigns which rely heavily on wealthy donors who give the maximum allowed by law, more than 99.9 percent of Sanders\u2019 donors can give again. In sharp contrast, Federal Election Commission reports indicate that more than 3 in 5 dollars given to Hillary Clinton come from donors who already have given her the maximum allowed by law.\u201cThe numbers we\u2019ve seen since Jan. 1 put our campaign on pace to beat Secretary Clinton\u2019s goal of $50 million in the first quarter of 2016,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager. \u201cWorking Americans chipping in a few dollars each month are not only challenging but beating the greatest fundraising machine ever assembled.\u201dWhile the Sanders campaign is supported by millions of small-dollar contributions, Clinton left the campaign trail in Iowa one day last week to hold a fundraiser in Philadelphia sponsored by leading executives of a large investment firm. It\u2019s not yet known how much she added at that event to her reported $17 million in campaign contributions over the years from Wall Street and financial services interests.Sanders also has refused to coordinate with a super PAC which Clinton and other candidates have used to take unlimited contributions from millionaires and billionaires. For example, Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing Clinton, claimed on Friday to have nearly $45 million cash on hand. Donors have pledged at least $42 million in additional contributions that would give her a bigger super PAC war chest than any Democratic fund ever before.\u201cAs Secretary Clinton holds high-dollar fundraisers with the nation\u2019s financial elite, our supporters have stepped up in a way that allows Bernie to spend the critical days before the caucuses talking to Iowans about his plans to fix a rigged economy and end a corrupt system of campaign finance,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cBernie\u2019s campaign is built for the long haul and we look forward to bringing his message to voters all across the nation, and to drawing millions of new people into the Democratic Party primary process,\u201d he added.Sanders\u2019 campaign on Sunday will file a year-end Federal Election Commission report showing that almost $33.6 million was raised in the fourth quarter of 2015. Seventy percent came from contributors giving $200 or less. Only 1.3 percent of the campaign\u2019s fourth quarter donations came from maxed-out contributors.While the Clinton campaign has not released information about the breakdown of its campaign contributions, its most recent report indicated that only 17.4 percent of the money raised came from small-dollar, un-itemized contributions. Her third quarter report indicated that about 60 percent of her money came from donors who already have contributed the maximum allowed by law and may not give again to her primary campaign.To read\u00a0the report, click here.", "author": "Bernie"}

Before, Sanders spoke to the University of Iowa audience about income and wealth inequality, the planetary crisis of global warming, making public colleges and universities tuition-free and other issues.A new poll released on Saturday by The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics showed Sanders\u2019 come-from-nowhere candidacy had turned into a too-close-to call contest with Hillary Clinton, once the pundits\u2019 presumptive nominee. The poll showed Clinton and Sanders in a virtual tie, a far cry from her 41-point lead when Sanders began his campaign eight months ago.Earlier Saturday, Sanders said his record was being distorted by Clinton\u2019s campaign. Speaking to a group of supporters in Charles City, Iowa, Sanders said he was disappointed in \u201ca lot of inaccurate statements regarding what I believe.\u201d\u201cThe new poll results reflect the remarkable grassroots excitement and energy that are the driving force behind Bernie\u2019s campaign to fix a rigged economy and the corrupt campaign finance system that props it up,\u201d said Robert Becker, Sanders\u2019 Iowa campaign state director.A Clinton television ad insinuated, for example, that Sanders somehow had attacked Planned Parenthood when, in fact, he has a \u201c100 percent lifetime voting record for Planned Parenthood.\u201d He also said Clinton had tried to falsely brand him as a friend of the National Rifle Association when, in fact, he has a D-minus grade from the NRA. \u201cSo don\u2019t tell me that I\u2019m defending or protecting the gun lobby,\u201d he said.\u201cThose are inaccuracies, and we can do better than that. Secretary Clinton and I have differences of opinion. Let\u2019s debate those differences of opinion, but let\u2019s not go around distorting a record that I am very proud of.\u201dWatch Sen. Sanders sing along to \u201cThis Land is Your Land\u201d:\n", "author": "Bernie"}

We are pleased to do it on March 3 before the Michigan primary provided the Clinton campaign will agree to Brooklyn, New York, on April 14. Why won\u2019t they debate in Brooklyn?

He doesn\u2019t have a super PAC.

It boasted on Friday that it raised more than $25 million during the last half of last year plus another $10 million this month alone.
