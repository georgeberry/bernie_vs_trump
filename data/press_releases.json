ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians.\n\n\nThe Mexican government\u00a0and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the Pope, because they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them. The Pope only heard one side of the story - he didn\u2019t see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States. He doesn\u2019t see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation.\n\n\nFor a religious leader to question a person\u2019s faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current President. No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man\u2019s religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.\n\n", "author": "Trump"}

I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me. My story is well documented, so I will not retell it here. However, what I will do with the remaining space is express my feelings about life, and the culture of life, as we approach the 43nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade.I build things. There is a process involved in building things. We tap into a lot of disciplines with engineering being one of the most important. The rules for putting structures together are as strict as are the rules of physics. These rules have stood the test of time and have become the path to putting together structures that endure and are beautiful. America, when it is at its best, follows a set of rules that have worked since our founding. One of those rules is that we, as Americans, revere life and have done so since our Founders made it the first, and most important, of our \u201cunalienable\u201d rights.Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of country. They are missing, and they are missed.The Supreme Court in 1973 based their decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found. Even if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress. Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best.If using taxpayer money to facilitate our slide to a culture of death was not enough, the 1973 decision became a landmark decision demonstrating the utter contempt the court had for federalism and the 10th Amendment. Roe v. Wade gave the court an excuse to dismantle the decisions of state legislatures and the votes of the people. This is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision. Perhaps Roe v. Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government.We are in the middle of a presidential political cycle and votes will be cast in just days. The citizens of this nation will have the chance to vote for candidates that are aligned with their individual worldviews. It is my hope that they will choose the builder, the man who has the ability to imagine the greatness of this nation. The next President must follow those principles that work best and that reinforce the reverence Americans hold for life. A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness. It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again.\u00a0", "author": "Trump"}

Like Ronald Reagan, on many issues, I have evolved.\n\n\nCruz says I am in favor of ObamaCare, when in fact I have spoken about repealing and replacing this disaster of a system at every speech throughout my campaign and since it\u2019s inception. Meanwhile, Cruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against ObamaCare twice.\n\n\nCruz says I will try to take away your second amendment rights, when I am one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms and I say so in every speech that I have made for years. I am a proud member of the NRA and so are my sons.\n\n\nCruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign.\n\n\nIn Iowa, Cruz told thousands of Ben Carson voters that Dr. Carson had left the race and to instead vote for Ted Cruz. He apologized when the race was over. Likewise, his fraudulent voter violation form sent to Iowa voters. If Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation, I have no choice but to fight back.\n\n\nOne of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President. If he doesn\u2019t take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately. Additionally, the RNC should intervene and if they don\u2019t they are in default of their pledge to me.\n\n\nI am the strongest on the borders and I will build a wall, and it will be a real wall. I am strongest on illegal immigration, strongest on ISIS, strongest on the military and I will take care of our Vets. I will end common core and preserve the second amendment. I will renegotiate our trade deals and bring our jobs back to our country. I am the only person who will Make America Great Again.\u00a0\n\n", "author": "Trump"}

FOX News is making tens of millions of dollars on debates, and setting ratings records (the highest in history), where as in previous years they were low-rated afterthoughts. \n\nUnlike the very stupid, highly incompetent people running our country into the ground, Mr. Trump knows when to walk away. Roger Ailes and FOX News think they can toy with him, but Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t play games. There have already been six debates, and according to all online debate polls including Drudge, Slate, Time Magazine, and many others, Mr. Trump has won all of them, in particular the last one. Whereas\u00a0he has always been a job creator and not a debater, he nevertheless truly enjoys the debating process\u00a0- and it has been very good for him, both in polls and popularity. \n\nHe will not be participating in the FOX News debate and will instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for the Veterans and Wounded Warriors, who have been treated so horribly by our all talk, no action politicians. Like running for office as an extremely successful person, this takes guts and it is the kind of\u00a0mentality our country needs in order to Make America Great Again.\n", "author": "Trump"}

In order to avoid a government shutdown, a cowardly threat from an incompetent President, the elected Republicans in Congress threw in the towel and showed absolutely no budget discipline.The American people will have to absorb higher deficits, greater debt, less economic liberty and more corporate welfare. Congress cannot seem to help itself in bending to every whim of special interests. How can they face their constituents when they continue to burden our children and grandchildren with debts they will never be able to repay? Our government is failing us, so we must do something about it. Who knows how bad things will be when the next administration comes in and has to pick up the pieces?The only special interest not being served by our government is the American people. It is time we imposed budget discipline by holding the line on spending, getting rid of waste, fraud and abuse, and by taking on our debt. To do these things, we need a President who can lead the fight to hold Congress and the rest of government accountable. Together, we can Make America Great Again.\" \u2013 Donald J.

Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.

In New York City, we get to look out on Central Park and see the leaves change as we move from the beauty of Fall to a magnificent city cloaked in the chill and briskness of Winter. What we Americans often gloss over is that November is a time for celebrating the very reason we enjoy the freedom, opportunity and prosperity found nowhere else in the world. The reason we are able to live like we do is due to the courage, dedication and sacrifice of those who serve in the armed forces of the United States and to those who have given the last full measure.This November we should pay particular attention to the world situation. All over the world, young men and women who have volunteered to serve this nation are standing watch to protect us from the evil that is focused on taking away all that we value. We have turmoil in the Middle East, unrest in Europe, aggressive expansion in the Pacific Rim and stateless terrorism that threatens every aspect of freedom all across the globe. At no time in history have things been so precarious. Yet, we are able to find the best among us to step forward and take on the traditions and values of generations past, humbly putting on the uniform of this nation. They do so to support and defend the Constitution, not the President, the Congress or even the flag. They swear to defend an idea and an ideal. As is so subtly stated in the Preamble of our Founding Document, they take on the task \"to secure Liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"On November 10th, the Marine Corps celebrated its 240th birthday. The Marines were, are and will remain unique in the world, a force that is first to fight and last to come home. The Marines have maintained the highest standards and \"once a Marine, always a Marine,\" captures the sense of duty and honor that permeates every pore of those who have worn the Eagle, Globe and Anchor.Today, we honor all veterans who are and have served in the armed forces. This day has special meaning to so many. Over the years, I have hired thousands of veteransand have found them to be among the very best. They bring no attention to themselves except in their extraordinary professionalism and dedication to whatever they choose to do. Quietly, humbly, and without fanfare, they go about their daily lives being great citizens, good moms and dads, and loving, devoted companions. Bearing up under the terrible damage of war, so many carry on with dignity and grace. We should be so proud of them and we should honor them every day.November is also the month we celebrate the Military Family. Too many of us have never had to be away from family and friends on holidays, birthdays and anniversaries. We have never been asked to risk life and limb in places we cannot even find on a map. We go about our daily lives enjoying freedom, most of the time without ever thinking about what it is like to have a loved one in harm's way. The sacrifice and strength of military families, those who also serve, is so important to morale and welfare of those so far from home.I have lived a full life and have benefited more than most from the opportunities found in this country. I have a loving, healthy family and I am running for President -- only in America. To be where I am, I thank God every day for those who stand on the ramparts of liberty with courage, strength, humility and dignity. So, this November, let's celebrate our veterans and their families and keep them in our prayers. Because of these dedicated Americans, we will be able to Make America Great Again!", "author": "Trump"}

Trump Addresses Highly Detrimental Currency Manipulation(New York, NY) November 10th, 2015- Donald J. Trump today unveiled his most recent policy on trade reforms, highlighting his position in a Wall Street Journal op-ed entitled Ending China's Currency Manipulation. Mr. Trump has consistently been a strong critic of these tactics that prohibit fair trade and have been largely neglected by the all talk, no action politicians that have failed us for far too long. Mr. Trumpoutlines common sense solutions to address the major threat of currency manipulation and trade reforms that will Make America Great Again.How We Got Here: Washington Politicians Let China Off The HookIn January 2000, President Bill Clinton boldly promised China's inclusion in the World Trade Organization (WTO) \"is a good deal for America. Our products will gain better access to China's market, and every sector from agriculture, to telecommunications, to automobiles. But China gains no new market access to the United States.\" None of what President Clinton promised came true. Since China joined the WTO, Americans have witnessed the closure of more than 50,000 factories and the loss of tens of millions of jobs. It was not a good deal for America then and it's a bad deal now. It is a typical example of how politicians in Washington have failed our country.The most important component of our China policy is leadership and strength at the negotiating table. We have been too afraid to protect and advance American interests and to challenge China to live up to its obligations. We need smart negotiators who will serve the interests of American workers - not Wall Street insiders that want to move U.S. manufacturing and investment offshore.The Goal Of The Trump Plan: Fighting For American Businesses And WorkersAmerica has always been a trading nation. Under the Trump administration trade will flourish. However, for free trade to bring prosperity to America, it must also be fair trade. Our goal is not protectionism but accountability. America fully opened its markets to China but China has not reciprocated. Its Great Wall of Protectionism uses unlawful tariff and non-tariff barriers to keep American companies out of China and to tilt the playing field in their favor.If you give American workers a level playing field, they will win. At its heart, this plan is a negotiating strategy to bring fairness to our trade with China. The results will be huge for American businesses and workers. Jobs and factories will stop moving offshore and instead stay here at home. The economy will boom. The steps outlined in this plan will make that a reality.When Donald J. Trump is president, China will be on notice that America is back in the global leadership business and that their days of currency manipulation and cheating are over. We will cut a better deal with China that helps American businesses and workers compete. The Trump Plan Will Achieve The Following Goals:1. Bring China to the bargaining table by immediately declaring it a currency manipulator.2. Protect American ingenuity and investment by forcing China to uphold intellectual property laws and stop their unfair and unlawful practice of forcing U.S. companies to share proprietary technology with Chinese competitors as a condition of entry to China's market.3. Reclaim millions of American jobs and reviving American manufacturing by putting an end to China's illegal export subsidies and lax labor and environmental standards. No more sweatshops or pollution havens stealing jobs from American workers.4. Strengthen our negotiating position by lowering our corporate tax rate to keep American companies and jobs here at home, attacking our debt and deficit so China cannot use financial blackmail against us, and bolstering the U.S. military presence in the East and South China Seas to discourage Chinese adventurism.The entire plan can be viewed here:www.DonaldJTrump.com/positions/us-china-trade-reform.", "author": "Trump"}

Continuing to allow illegal immigrants to cross a weak border is hurting America\u2019s economy.\n\n\nMany politicians in Washington talk about the border but have no idea how dangerous it really is. I went to the border to make sure the American people have the opportunity to see the truth.\n\nMeeting with Laredo Mayor Pete Saenz, City Manager Jesus Olivares, and the Laredo Police Department\nEarlier this week I hosted my South Carolina campaign kickoff. Hundreds of veterans came to watch my speech. I announced the launch of a new hotline, 855 \u2013 VETS \u2013 352, and email address, veterans@donaldtrump.com, for Veterans to share their stories about the need to reform our Veterans Administration. The way veterans are being treated in our country is a disgrace and I am the candidate that will fix it.\n\nMeeting with veterans in South Carolina\nI made a campaign stop in Nevada to speak at Freedom Fest. In front of 2,000 energized conservatives I made a pledge that I will remake today; as President I will restore the American free market and ensure that companies are incentivized to bring factories and jobs back to American soil.\n\nSpeaking at Freedom Fest\nI also traveled to Phoenix to host a rally.\n15,000 people showed up. It was an incredible testament to the deep commitment of the American people to restoring American greatness. We have stayed silent for far too longwatching bad policies wreak havoc on our economy and our nation. I will take care of our veterans, rebuild our military, and secure our borders.\n\nOur incredible crowd in Phoenix, AZ\nMost politicians would have backed down after being relentlessly targeted by the media.\nI will never stop speaking out on behalf of all Americans.\nWe have been bringing our message across America over the past several weeks. In California I met with\nthe families of six victims who were killed by illegal aliens. Each family shared their story. It was a heartbreaking reminder of why we must secure our border \u2013 to make sure no more Americans are senselessly killed by illegal aliens.\nOur unprotected border is a threat to the stability of our economy, the personal safety of Americans, and our national security. Too many American lives have been lost because our leaders refuse to secure the border.\n\nStanding with the families of victims\nI also filed my\nFEC financial disclosure form. I have spent my life building businesses in large American cities and small American towns. I will use my experience to put Americans back to work \u2013 and the polls prove that the people know I am the only one who can do it.\n\nSome of our enthusiastic supporters\nThis campaign is about changing Washington. We need to once again have a government that is of the people, for the people and by the people.\nWe will make America Great Again!", "author": "Trump"}

These veterans have pledged their support to Mr. Trump in the primary, and they will be advocating for him among other veterans and military families in New Hampshire, where there continues to be overwhelming support for Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump stated, \u201cOur Veterans are incredibly important and I\u2019m proud to have the support of this coalition, especially in New Hampshire, where if I am elected I will build a full-service, first-class VA hospital to ensure all New Hampshire Veterans received the care they deserve.

We have some very serious issues facing this country that are going to take a steely-eyed, proven, tough leader to overcome. Furthermore, should Mr. Trump find his way into the White House, he won't owe anything to anyone except the American people. Mr. Trump is a Patriot who loves his country, the American people, and cares about America being respected and great again. I believe he has what it takes to restore the faith of America's allies and be respected by our enemies once more.\"In addition to forming the New Hampshire Veterans Coalition, earlier this week Mr. Trump established a hotline (855- VETS- 352) and email address (veterans@donaldtrump.com) for Veterans to share their stories about the need to reform our Veterans Administration.

Trump filed his Personal Financial Disclosure (PFD) forms with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).  This report was not designed for a man of Mr. Trump's massive wealth. For instance, they have boxes once a certain number is reached that simply state $50 million or more. Many of these boxes have been checked. As an example, if a building owned by Mr. Trump is worth $1.5 billion, the box checked is \u201c$50,000,000 or more.\u201d Mr. Trump stated, \u201cFirst people said I would never run, and I did. Then, they said, I would never file my statement of candidacy with the FEC, and I did. Next, they said I would never file my personal financial disclosure forms. I filed them early despite the fact that I am allowed two 45 days extensions. Now I have surged in the polls and am fighting to Make America Great Again. I look forward to the challenge of winning the presidency and doing a fantastic job for our country. I will make the United States rich and strong and respected again, but also a country with a 'big heart' toward the care of our people.\u201d Mr. Trump's net worth has increased since the more than one year old financial statement produced at his presidential announcement. Real estate values in New York City, San Francisco, Miami and many other places where he owns property have gone up considerably during this period of time. His debt is a very small percentage of value, and at very low interest rates. As of this date, Mr. Trump's net worth is in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.  Mr. Trump's income for the year 2014, as reported in the PFD statement, is $362 million dollars (which does not include dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties).  In addition, he was successful in choosing multiple stocks which were sold in January 2014. Even though stock market purchases are not something that Mr. Trump has focused on in the past, and while only a small part of his net worth, 40 of the 45 stocks purchased went up in a relatively short period of time, creating a gain of $27,021,471, not including those stocks still remaining in the portfolio which currently have an unrealized gain of over $22 million (schedule attached).  Mr. Trump showed almost 500 business entities of which 91% are owned 100% by him. Mr. Trump wrote Trump: The Art of the Deal, one of the bestselling business books of all time, and numerous other bestsellers over the years.  NBC/Universal renewed, at the upfronts this year, The Apprentice (for a 15th season), but Mr. Trump decided to turn them down in order to run for President of the United States. NBC was not happy.

Trump released the following statement in response to the Obama Administration\u2019s agreement with Iran.\u00a0The Obama Administration\u2019s agreement with Iran is very dangerous. Iran developing a nuclear weapon, either through uranium or nuclear fuel, and defying the world is still a very real possibility. The inspections will not be followed, and Iran will no longer have any sanctions. Iran gets everything and loses nothing. Every promise the Obama Administration made in the beginning of negotiations, including the vow (made at the beginning of the negotiations) to get our great American prisoners returned to the U. S. has been broken. This is a bad deal that sets a dangerous precedent. This deal sets off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, which is the most-unstable region in the world. It is a horrible and perhaps catastrophic event for Israel.Furthermore, we should have kept the billions of dollars we have agreed to pay them. Any great dealmaker would know this is a perfect example of \u201ctapping along\u201d and because they have been unchecked for so long throughout this extremely lengthy process, I guarantee they are much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than they were at the start of negotiations.

Only 2.3 percent of Sanders\u2019 total money raised comes from maxed-out donors. With far fewer total donors, Clinton has tapped out more than 23,000 of her donors who have given to her campaign committee all that the law allows for the primary election and may donate no more. Her maxed-out donors provided nearly 60 percent of the primary money raised for her campaign committee.Another way to gauge support is to examine donations of $200 or more, the legal threshold for which donations must be itemized in FEC reports. In Clinton\u2019s case, 83 percent of her money came from donors who gave more than $200. In contrast, only 26 percent of the money raised for Sanders came from donors above the $200 threshold.Tallying contributions from small donors is another yardstick that campaign finance analysts examine. Sanders reported more than $23.4 million in fourth quarter donations of less than $200. That\u2019s out of a total $33.6 million raised in the last quarter of the year. Despite an aggressive online campaign designed to jack up the number of her small donors, Clinton\u2019s total take for her campaign committee in the last three months of 2015 in un-itemized donations totaled only $5.7 million of her more than $38 million total haul for the quarter.Sanders\u2019 small-dollar donors continue to be the financial backbone of his campaign. Last month alone, nearly $21 million was donated to him. The money came in the form of 812,012 separate contributions averaging only $26 apiece. That brought the total number of donations since Sanders launched his campaign last April 30 to more than 3.3 million, a record for any presidential candidate at that point in a campaign.Clinton has been criticized for her heavy reliance on donations from Wall Street and other special interests. For example, she left the campaign trail in Iowa one day last week to hold a fundraiser in Philadelphia sponsored by leading executives of a large investment firm. And The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the super PAC backing Clinton amassed $15 million of the $25 million it raised in the second half of last year from Wall Street sources.To read Sanders\u2019 FEC report, click here.", "author": "Bernie"}

That\u2019s a record at this point in the campaign for any White House candidate.Unlike other campaigns which rely heavily on wealthy donors who give the maximum allowed by law, more than 99.9 percent of Sanders\u2019 donors can give again.

For example, Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing Clinton, claimed on Friday to have nearly $45 million cash on hand. Donors have pledged at least $42 million in additional contributions that would give her a bigger super PAC war chest than any Democratic fund ever before.\u201cAs Secretary Clinton holds high-dollar fundraisers with the nation\u2019s financial elite, our supporters have stepped up in a way that allows Bernie to spend the critical days before the caucuses talking to Iowans about his plans to fix a rigged economy and end a corrupt system of campaign finance,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cBernie\u2019s campaign is built for the long haul and we look forward to bringing his message to voters all across the nation, and to drawing millions of new people into the Democratic Party primary process,\u201d he added.Sanders\u2019 campaign on Sunday will file a year-end Federal Election Commission report showing that almost $33.6 million was raised in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Her posturing in that campaign prompted Obama\u2019s famous statement that she sounded like \u201cAnnie Oakley.\u201d The 2008 Clinton campaign sent out a mailer attacking then-Senator Obama, a mailer that was subsequently used by the NRA to echo those attacks in October 2008.In the 2016 campaign, she has now moved back to calling for more gun control but apparently is downplaying her views in Iowa for tactical advantage.Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager said, \u201cWhen you really believe an issue is important you don\u2019t hide it from voters in one state to gain political advantage. This is exactly what is wrong with the political process. It\u2019s no secret that Secretary Clinton has repeatedly changed her views on gun safety from one election to another. Now we see the Clinton campaign is gaming its message from one state to the other within the 2016 election. \u201cThe AP analysis can be found here.The story about the NRA\u2019s use of Clinton material to attack then-Senator Obama can be found here.To read more about Sanders record on guns, click here.", "author": "Bernie"}

Where quality health care will be a birthright of every citizen. Where a good job is not a wish but a reality. Where women receive equal pay and a living wage is paid to all. An America where after a lifetime of labor there is time for rest and grandchildren. A nation that defends our people and our values but no longer carries so much of that burden alone.\u201dSanders has released comprehensive policy proposals to confront the problems facing the nation. He has detailed plans to make public colleges and universities tuition free, expand health care to all Americans, put 13 million Americans to work in good-paying jobs rebuilding the country\u2019s crumbling roads and bridges, pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, raise the minimum wage to a living wage, expand social security and defeat the Islamic State while avoiding perpetual warfare in the Middle East.\u201cI know we can create that America if we listen to our hearts.

Bernie Sanders on Monday denounced \u201ccorporate deserters\u201d after Johnson Controls and Tyco International announced a plan to merge the manufacturing giants in the latest example of a U.S.-based company acquiring a foreign firm to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\u201cThe potential Johnson-Tyco merger would be a disaster for American taxpayers,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cProfitable companies that have received corporate welfare from American taxpayers should not be allowed to renounce their U.S. citizenship to avoid paying U.S. taxes. These corporate inversions must stop.\u201cMy message to these corporate deserters is simple: You can\u2019t be an American company only when you want corporate welfare from American taxpayers or you want lucrative contracts from the federal government,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cIf you want the advantages of being an American company then you can\u2019t run away from America to avoid paying taxes.\u201dSanders last year introduced the Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act. It would end the inversion tax scam by treating corporations as American corporations for tax purposes when it is still majority owned by U.S. interests.In November, Sanders called on the Obama administration and Congress to stop a similar deal involving Pfizer and Allergan that would lead to higher prescription drug prices. \u201cThe Pfizer-Allergan merger would be a disaster for American consumers who already pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,\u201d Sanders said at the time. \u201cIt also would allow another major American corporation to hide its profits overseas.\u201dSanders\u2019 Senate bill also would also stop corporations from avoiding $100 billion in taxes a year by stashing their profits in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens.", "author": "Bernie"}

A CBS News Battleground Tracker poll released earlier Sunday showed Sanders holding a one-point edge over Clinton. The same survey had Sanders 19 points ahead in New Hampshire and gaining ground in South Carolina.\u201cOn Feb. 1 you have the opportunity to say that it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics and together we are going to take this country in a very different direction and that in fact we are going to make a political revolution,\u201d Sanders said.On foreign policy, Sanders contrasted his vote against the war in Iraq with Clinton\u2019s support for the 2002 invasion. \u201cThat is a difference in judgement in what turns out to be the most important foreign policy moment in the modern history of the United States,\u201d Sanders said.On Wall Street reform, Sanders has introduced legislation to break up the biggest banks to protect consumers and spare taxpayers from future bailouts like the 2008 taxpayer rescue of Wall Street. \u201cIn my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud,\u201d he said. \u201cToday three out of the four largest banks in this country are larger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail. The time is now to break them up. That is not the position of Secretary Clinton,\u201d Sanders added.On paid family leave, Sanders laid out his support for bills in Congress to provide three months of paid leave. The legislation, introduced by leading Democratic women in the Senate and House, would pay for the program with a $1.61 payroll tax. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good investment,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cSecretary Clinton does not support that legislation.\u201dOn Social Security, Sanders detailed his plan to expand and extend the retirement and disability program by making the wealthiest Americans pay the same share of their income into the system as everyone else. He agrees with President Barack Obama\u2019s proposal to lift the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax. His legislation would make those earning more than $250,000 pay the same tax rate as those who earn $118,500 or less. \u201cOn that issue, I support lifting the cap. Secretary Clinton does not,\u201d Sanders said.On the planetary crisis of climate change, Sanders was a leader opposing a pipeline to ship some of the dirtiest oil on the planet from the tar sands region of Alberta, Canada, to refineries in Texas. \u201cIf we are going to transform our energy system and move away from fossil fuel we cannot support the Keystone pipeline,\u201d he said. \u201cI was out front on that issue, Hillary Clinton did come out late in opposition to the Keystone pipeline. I would have appreciated it if she had come out earlier.\u201d Sanders also has opposed the proposed Bakken Pipeline that cuts through Iowa and three other states. Clinton has not taken a position. Clinton also refused to release a comprehensive plan to stop the worst effects of climate change, despite saying she would in July 2015.Overarching all other issues, Sanders said, is the corrupt campaign finance system which allows millionaires and corporations to try to buy elections so they can control Congress and protect their special interests.\u201cWe are living with a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe people of Iowa will have to determine \u2026 which candidate is willing to stand up to Wall Street and the billionaire class and represent working families.\u201dThe CBS poll released today showed that 91 percent of Iowa Democratic voters believe Sanders would pick regular people over big donors.", "author": "Bernie"}

Barack Obama. \u201cIt reminds me of what happened here in Iowa eight years ago,\u201d Sanders said of the doubts she tried to plant about Obama\u2019s and now his experience and electability. \u201cBut you know what, people in Iowa saw through those attacks then and they\u2019re going to see though those attacks again.\u201dIn fact, polls show Sanders is far more electable. In general election matchups with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, Sanders substantially outpolls Clinton. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in mid-January, for example, found that in Iowa, a battleground state, Sanders was 13 points over Trump, 51 percent to 38 percent. Clinton\u2019s margin over Trump was only eight points.Sanders also spoke here and earlier Saturday in Davenport, Iowa, about Wall Street jitters about his growing success.\u201cIt appears that we have Wall Street a little bit nervous and that is a good thing,\u201d Sanders told volunteers at a field office in Davenport, Iowa, as they prepared for a day of door-knocking to bring people out to the Feb. 1 precinct caucuses.He was referring to a Wall Street Journal interview, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with Stephen Schwarzman, the head of the Blackstone Group, a global private equity firm. Schwarzman blamed Sanders for rattling stock markets because of his growing support coupled with a sense that \u201cwe have Republicans on the other hand who don\u2019t inspire enormous confidence in terms of their ability perhaps to handle that job.\u201dSanders has made Wall Street reform a major issue in the contest for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. In a speech in New York City earlier this month, Sanders said Wall Street\u2019s business model is \u201cfraud\u201d and questioned whether Clinton\u2019s plan to regulate the financial industry would work. He also spoke about \u201cvery generous speaking fees\u201d Clinton accepted from financial institutions, a reference to more than $3 million she took in 2013 alone from Goldman Sachs and other big banks.", "author": "Bernie"}

More than 87,000 metric tons of methane gas have escaped into the air. Methane traps more than 85 times the heat of carbon dioxide. The scale of the Porter Ranch leak would equal the emissions of six coal-burning power plants or an additional 7 million cars on the road. In climate terms, this leak compares with the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\u201cMore directly, thousands of residents have been put out of their homes and local schools have been closed. And the health risk is real \u2013 methane exposure can cause headaches, vomiting and bloody noses.\u201cToday I am calling for a sense of national urgency and action to stop this leak. The EPA needs to expedite action on its investigation. Southern California Gas Company needs to do much more, apply more resources to close the leak and release complete air quality data. It is simply unacceptable that a gas leak which began last October is still poisoning the air and that the company continues to profit from the storage facility.\u201cIt also appears fracking of nearby wells could have contributed to this disaster.

I opposed Keystone XL from Day One. I am the only candidate for president who has opposed the Bakken Pipeline in Iowa, and the proposed pipelines in New Hampshire and Vermont carrying fracked gas.\u201cI will continue to stand up to the big money and lobbying power of Big Oil and fight for a new energy system based on clean sources of power like wind and solar, creating millions of new jobs \u2013 and saving our planet.\u201d", "author": "Bernie"}

The former secretary of state also languished behind Sanders in general election matchups against the other Republican White House hopefuls, according to the poll for WMUR-TV and CNN.Results released on Tuesday from the same University of New Hampshire Research Center survey found that 60 percent of likely Democratic Party primary voters say they would vote for Sanders compared to 33 percent for Clinton.\u201cThere is excitement and energy for Bernie that no other candidate can match,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager. \u201cHis message that it is time to do something about the rigged economy propped up by a corrupt campaign finance system is resonating with voters in New Hampshire and other states.Sanders \u201ccurrently has double digit leads over five potential Republican challengers in New Hampshire\u201d while Clinton leads Trump \u201cbut is deadlocked with four other potential challengers,\u201d according to the University of New Hampshire Research Center.\u201cHillary Clinton says Democrats should look at which candidate is the most electable and we couldn\u2019t agree more,\u201d Weaver added. \u201cThese new poll numbers in New Hampshire are the most recent evidence that Bernie would be the best Democratic nominee to retain the White House and help regain the Senate and elect Democrats all across the country.\u201dIn a hypothetical contest with Trump, Sanders led by 23 points in New Hampshire, outpolling the Republican real estate developer by 57 percent to 34 percent. Clinton, by contrast, has only a single-digit margin over Trump, 48 percent to 39 percent.Driving this divide is Sanders\u2019 strength with independent voters, in contrast to Clinton who struggles with this key bloc of voters. Notably, Sanders leads Trump with independents by a 22-point margin while Clinton actually trails the real estate mogul by 9 points, a net 31-point difference.\u201cThis same pattern emerges in all of the head-to-head match-ups with Republicans between Sanders and Clinton,\u201d said Sanders\u2019 pollster Ben Tulchin. \u201cThis real strength with independents \u2013 both overall and especially compared to Clinton \u2013 positions Sanders very well for the general election and gives him a real edge over Clinton as the more electable candidate, especially recalling that New Hampshire is a swing state that Al Gore lost in the 2000 general election.\u201dSanders led Christie and Cruz by 23 points, was 21 points up on Kasich and 18 points over Rubio. Clinton lost to Rubio, tied Kasich and led Christie by less than the survey\u2019s margin of error.", "author": "Bernie"}

Bernie Sanders on Sunday detailed a Medicare-for-all plan to provide better health care for all Americans at less cost.\u201cUniversal health care is an idea that has been supported in the United States by Democratic presidents going back to Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt is time for our country to join every other major industrialized nation on earth and guarantee health care to all citizens as a right, not a privilege.\u201dThe proposal would expand Medicare, the popular and successful health care program for seniors, and build on the success of the Affordable Care Act, which Sanders helped craft. Patients would be able to choose their own doctors and receive comprehensive care for everything from hospital stays to emergency room visits to primary and specialty care.Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-all plan would save $6 trillion over the next 10 years compared to the current system, according to a detailed analysis by Gerald Friedman, an economist at University of Massachusetts at Amherst who is a leading expert on health care costs.In a nation that now spends $3 trillion a year on health care \u2013 nearly $10,000 per person \u2013 Sanders\u2019 plan would save consumers money by eliminating expensive and wasteful private health insurance. The plan would save taxpayers money by dramatically reducing overall health care costs and bringing down skyrocketing prescription drug prices which are far greater in the United States than in any other country.The typical family earning $50,000 a year would save nearly $6,000 annually in health care costs, Friedman calculated. The average working family now pays $4,955 in premiums for private insurance and spends another $1,318 on deductibles for care that isn\u2019t covered. Under Sanders\u2019 plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would pay just $466 per year to the Medicare-for-all program.Businesses would save more than $9,400 a year in health care costs under Sanders\u2019 plan. The average annual cost to the employer for a worker with a family who makes $50,000 a year would go from $12,591 to just $3,100.The shift to universal health care would be paid for with a 2.2 percent health care premium (calculated under the rules for federal income taxes); a 6.2 percent health care payroll tax paid by employers; an estate tax on the wealthiest Americans and changes in the tax code to make federal income tax rates more progressive.Under the plan, individuals making $250,000 to $500,000 a year would be taxed at a rate of 37 percent. The top rate, 52 percent, would apply to those earning $10 million or more a year, a category that in 2013 included only the 13,000 wealthiest households in the United States.Additional savings would be achieved from reducing outlays for taxpayer-supported health care expenditures.Sanders laid out his health care plan and progressive tax reform proposals here in South Carolina where he and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley were to take part on Sunday night in a nationally televised debate in their contest for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.To read more about Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-all plan and his progressive tax proposals, click here.\nTo read Professor Gerald Friedman\u2019s analysis of Sanders\u2019 plan, click here.", "author": "Bernie"}

In 2006, Henry Paulson left his job as chairman of Goldman Sachs to become Treasury secretary. In 2008, Paulson asked Congress to pass legislation giving him a blank check of $700 billion to bailout Wall Street.\u201cUnder my administration, top executives of Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street CEOs will no longer go through the revolving door from Wall Street to government,\u201d Sanders said.Sanders pledge to fill financial posts with regulators who are not beholden to Wall Street came as he made the case for his sweeping plan to rein in the greed of the nation\u2019s biggest financial institutions. In laying out the proposal during a major speech last week in New York, Sanders pledged to break up the biggest banks. He also advocated restoring the post-Depression Glass-Steagall Act to prevent Wall Street speculators from crashing the economy. He also said his administration will cap credit card interest rates and ATM fees, allow post offices to offer basic banking services and reform the Federal Reserve to focus on its mandate to promote full employment.Sanders plan is backed by some 170 economists and other experts, including former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, University of Texas Professor James K.

This year, for only the third time in 40 years, seniors on Social Security are not receiving a cost-of-living increase.

Bernie Sanders promised to remake the financial system to serve America\u2019s working families.\u201cWe can no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that has been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI\u2019ll rein in Wall Street behavior, so they can\u2019t crash our economy again. Will they like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I\u2019m president? You better believe it.\u201dSanders presented a sweeping plan to rein in the greed of the nation\u2019s biggest financial institutions, drawing sharp contrasts with Sec. Clinton\u2019s approach. \u201cMy opponent says that as a senator she told bankers to \u2018cut it out\u2019 and end their destructive behavior,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to \u2018cut it out.\u2019 The reality is that Congress doesn\u2019t regulate Wall Street. Wall Street and their lobbyists regulate Congress. We must change that reality and as president I will.\u201dSanders\u2019 administration will create a list of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d institutions by the end of his first 100 days in the White House. \u201dWithin one-year, my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy,\u201d he said. Sanders will accomplish this goal by appointing strong regulators who will utilize Section 121 of Dodd-Frank to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system by breaking up large banks and shadow banks that pose a grave threat to the economy.Sanders promised to fight to establish a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt designed to prevent Wall Street speculators from crashing the economy. He also said his administration will cap ATM fees, allow post offices to offer banking services and reform the Federal Reserve to focus on its full employment mandate.\u201cSecretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits. On this issue, Secretary Clinton is wrong. Shadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally insured bank deposits of big commercial banks \u2013 something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act,\u201d Sanders said.Sanders also said he will fight to cap ATM fees at $2, cap interest rates on credit cards and loans at 15 percent, establish modest banking services at post offices, and turn credit rating agencies into non-profits that are committed to accurately rating financial products, and are not beholden to Wall Street.\u201cNot one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy,\u201d Sanders said before describing some of the biggest crimes committed by financial institutions in recent years. \u201cThat will change under my administration. \u2018Equal justice under law\u2019 will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the Supreme Court.

We judge a country not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it produces, but by how it treats the most vulnerable people,\u201d Sanders told the crowd of 280.\u201cWe\u2019ve got too many seniors who are struggling to provide for their basic needs. Instead of giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country, we should pay attention to the needs of senior citizens trying to survive on as little as $12,000 a year,\u201d he added.Sanders has introduced a bill in the U.S. Senate to bring down prescription drug prices, which soared more than 12 percent in 2014, the biggest jump in a decade. The legislation by Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland would authorize the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Their bills also would make it legal to import less expensive drugs from Canada and other countries.\u201cIf I am elected president of the United States, the pharmaceutical industry will know who the president is and their greed is going to end,\u201d Sanders said.On Social Security, he told seniors that there will be no cost-of-living increase this year. It is only the third time in 40 years that payments will stay flat. Sanders said the consumer price index, which is used to calculate annual COLAs, does not accurately reflect how inflation in health care costs and prescription drug prices impact seniors. Sanders has proposed legislation to increase COLAs by accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors.Also under Sanders\u2019 Social Security plan, the wealthiest Americans who make more than $250,000 a year would pay the same share of their income into Social Security as everyone else. Current law now caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes at $118,500. Sanders\u2019 proposal to lift the cap would raise taxes only on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of Americans. The new revenue would expand Social Security benefits by an average of $65 a month, increase cost-of-living adjustments and lift seniors out of poverty by boosting benefits for low-income beneficiaries.Social Security is a key source of income for 42,000 people in New Hampshire whose benefits in 2014 averaged about $15,000. Without Social Security, more than 41 percent of the elderly in New Hampshire would be living in poverty. With Social Security, the elderly poverty rate in New Hampshire is just 5.7 percent.", "author": "Bernie"}

Bernie Sanders on Sunday brought his campaign for the Democratic Party presidential nomination to the Reno Ballroom here and told more than 2,000 supporters that \u201cwith your support we\u2019re going to win here in Nevada.\u201d \n\u201cWe have a path toward victory not only to win this election but most importantly to transform our country,\u201d Sanders told Nevadans. Sanders leads Hillary Clinton in recent polls in New Hampshire and is within striking distance of the lead in Iowa. After Iowa\u2019s Feb. 1 precinct caucuses and New Hampshire\u2019s Feb. 9 primary election, Nevada is the next state to play a critical role in the nomination process with caucuses on Feb. 20. In reality, Sanders said, the presidential nomination process kicked off long ago for Republican White House hopefuls last April at a Las Vegas casino. What was dubbed the \u201cAdelson Primary\u201d was staged by billionaire gambling tycoon Sheldon Adelson who welcomed a parade of Republican hopefuls to his posh Las Vegas casino to vie for his financial support. Adelson and other billionaires have exploited the corrupt campaign finance system ushered in by a Supreme Court ruling in a case known as Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission. That disastrous 5-4 decision in 2010 opened the floodgates for corporations and billionaires like Adelson to spend unlimited sums to bankroll candidates. Earlier Sunday, Sanders spoke to about 140 supporters at a union hall here with members of the three major national labor organizations which have the endorsed him: the Communications Workers of America, National Nurses United and the American Postal Workers Union. At another meeting with some 160 seniors and others, Sanders said protecting Social Security is a top priority at a time when more than half of workers nearing retirement have no savings. He also called for reining in runaway prescription drug prices and stopping cuts to Medicare. The Reno stops were on the first day of a two-day trip to Nevada. Later this week, Sanders returns to Iowa before heading back to New Hampshire next weekend.", "author": "Bernie"}

Bernie Sanders has significantly narrowed Hillary Clinton\u2019s margin in a new national poll that showed him making dramatic gains with African-Americans and Latinos.Overall, Sanders cut Clinton\u2019s lead almost in half, reducing it by 12 points in the new CNN/ORC poll.Support for Sanders has grown to 34 percent among registered voters who are Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. That\u2019s a four-point pickup for Sanders since November.Clinton has fallen to 50 percent, a significant eight-point drop in her standing since the same survey was conducted last month. The reversal for Clinton was remarkable because it came after support for her increased in three previous CNN polls.In an interview broadcast Thursday morning on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d anchor Chris Cuomo told Sanders \u201cthe Santa Claus of political polls has brought you a gift, the highest number you\u2019ve reached so far in the new CNN poll\u2026\u201dSanders noted the progress his campaign has made from polls earlier this year that showed his support in single digits.\u201cAll of the pundits considered us a fringe candidacy. Today, we\u2019re perhaps in the lead in New Hampshire, where I think we\u2019re closing in here in Iowa, and your poll seems to indicate we have national momentum,\u201d Sanders said in the interview taped in Council Bluffs, Iowa.\u201cWe have come a really long way in 7 1/2 months,\u201d Sanders added. \u201cWe have a tremendous volunteer network all over this country.

In a survey last April, he had only 1 percent of voters in that category. As he made a concerted effort to reach out to African-Americans and Latinos, Sanders support has grown to an impressive 32 percent in the most recent poll.Turning to the general election, several recent polls show Sanders holding a big advantage over Republican front-runner Donald Trump and faring better than Clinton against potential Republican nominees.A Quinnipiac University poll released on Tuesday found Sanders leading Trump by 13 percentage points, 51 percent to 38 percent. \u201cIf this margin held in a general election, Democrats would almost certainly regain control of the United States Senate and very possibly the House of Representatives,\u201d according to Bent Budowsky, a columnist for the The Hill newspaper.The CNN poll did not ask voters about a Sanders-Trump contest. The survey did show Clinton with a statistically-insignificant two-point edge over Trump, 49 percent to 47 percent. She has slipped from a five-point lead over Trump two months ago.

Bernie Sanders discussed criminal justice reform during a round-table meeting Monday at the Village Leadership Academy on the city\u2019s near West Side. Illinois State Rep. La Shawn K. Ford of Chicago led the discussion. \nAt a news conference afterward, Sanders recalled his participation in civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s when he was a student at the University of Chicago. \u201cInstitutional racism existed then. Institutional racism exists today. The criminal justice system was broken then. The criminal justice system is broken today,\u201d he said. \u201cI consider reforming our criminal justice system one of the most important things that a president of the United States can do.\u201dSanders called it an international embarrassment that the United States has more prisoners than any other country and a disproportionate number of those behind bars are minorities. And reciting shocking statistics, Sanders said one in four black males born today can expect to spend time in prison during their lifetime. He said blacks are imprisoned at six times the rate of whites and that minorities are sentenced to death at significantly higher rates than whites, which is one reason why he would end capital punishment. He also noted that the Department of Justice found that blacks were three times more likely to be searched during a traffic stop compared to white motorists. \u201cThat is unacceptable,\u201d Sanders said.Sanders also mentioned the prison death of Sandra Bland who died last July in a Texas jail cell after her arrest and jailing for a routine traffic violation. Bland, 28, had lived in Naperville, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. A grand jury on Monday declined to press charges against personnel in the sheriff\u2019s office jail where she was found dead.Sanders\u2019 criminal justice reform proposals include eliminating for-profit prisons; ending mandatory minimum sentencing and giving judges the discretion to better tailor sentences to the specific facts of a given case. He also would remove marijuana from the federal list of controlled substances and let states decide whether possession should be a crime.He also called for ensuring that police forces reflect the diversity of our communities. The senator would require greater civilian oversight of police departments. He would make law enforcement officers wear body cameras to help hold them accountable while protecting the privacy of innocent people. And he would provide federal funding to help state and local governments adopt new policing standards.", "author": "Bernie"}

I want to apologize to my supporters, this is not the type of campaign that we run and if I find anybody else involved in this they will also be fired,\u201d Sanders said.He addressed questions about the DNC voter database at the outset of the debate one day after the party reinstated his campaign\u2019s access to the critically-important voter database. The DNC backed down after Sanders\u2019 campaign sued in U.S. District Court in Washington.On at least two occasions, Sanders said, sensitive data was exposed because of flaws in DNC vendors\u2019 software programs.In one instance, about two months ago, Sanders campaign staffers discovered a vulnerability in the DNC software program and quietly reported the problem to the DNC. On that occasion, Sanders said, \u201cour staff at that point did exactly the right thing\u201d and reported the flaw to the party. The DNC once again \u201cscrewed up\u201d in a second instance last Wednesday. On that occasion, however, Sanders\u2019 campaign aides \u201cdid the wrong thing\u201d and looked at Clinton campaign records. The data director for the campaign was fired and the campaign is investigating whether others acted improperly.In the second instance, the data breach was leaked to the press and the DNC arbitrarily decided to shut off the Sanders campaign\u2019s access to its own information, \u201ccrippling our campaign,\u201d Sanders said.Because of the pattern of serious mistakes by the DNC, Sanders called for \u201can independent investigation of all of the breaches that have occurred from Day One in our campaign.\u201dSanders said he hopes the investigation will determine whether his campaign data has been breached by Clinton campaign aides. \u201cI am not convinced that our information may not have ended up in her campaign, don\u2019t know that, but we need an independent investigation and I hope that Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that last point.\u201d", "author": "Bernie"}

It argued that without the database, the campaign would lose some $600,000 a day in donations.The campaign\u2019s access to the database should be restored by Saturday morning in time for the campaign staff and volunteers to contact voters over the weekend.\u201cWe are extremely pleased that the DNC has reversed its outrageous decision to take Sen.

MoveOn.org collected another 250,000 petition signatures and Democracy for America collected 100,000.Earlier on Friday, Democracy for America issued a statement from Executive Director Charles Chamberlain saying, \u201cThe Democratic National Committee\u2019s decision to attack the campaign that figured out the problem, rather than go after the vendor that made the mistake, is profoundly damaging to the party\u2019s Democratic process.

{"url": "https://berniesanders.com/press-release/statement-jeff-weaver/", "text": "Two months ago, shortly after our digital vendor who conducts modeling for our campaign told us that there was failure in the firewall that prevents campaigns from seeing one another\u2019s data, we contacted the DNC and told them about the failure. We were concerned that our data could be compromised and we were assured at the time the firewall would be restored.Instead, we found out two days ago that once again, this sensitive and important data was compromised because the DNC and its vendor failed to protect it.We have invested enormous campaign resources in acquiring the rights to use this proprietary information. But the DNC, in an inappropriate overreaction, has denied us access to our own data.Let me briefly discuss the three issues involved here.First, this is not the first time that the vendor hired by the DNC to run the voter file program, NGP VAN, has allowed serious failures to occur. On more than one occasion, they have dropped the firewall between the data of competing Democratic campaigns. That is dangerous incompetence. It was our campaign months ago that alerted the DNC to the fact that campaign data was being made available to other campaigns. At that time our campaign did not run to the media, relying instead on assurances from the vendor that the problem would be resolved. Unfortunately, the other day, the vendor once again dropped the firewall between the campaigns for some data.Secondly, after discussion with the DNC it became clear that some of our staffers irresponsibly accessed some of the data from another campaign. That behavior is unacceptable to the Sanders campaign and we fired the staffer immediately and made certain that any information obtained was not utilized. We are now speaking to other staffers who might have been involved and further disciplinary action may be taken. Clearly, while that information was made available to our campaign because of the incompetence of the vendor, it should not have been looked at. Period.Thirdly, rather incredibly, the leadership of the DNC has used this incident to shut down our ability to access our own information, information which is the lifeblood of any campaign. This is the information about our supporters, our volunteers, the lists of people we intend to contact in Iowa, New Hampshire and elsewhere. This is information that we have worked hard to obtain. It is our information, not the DNCs.In other words, by their action, the leadership of the Democratic National Committee is now actively attempting to undermine our campaign. This is unacceptable. Individual leaders of the DNC can support Hillary Clinton in any way they want, but they are not going to sabotage our campaign \u2013 one of the strongest grassroots campaigns in modern history.We are announcing today that if the DNC continues to hold our data hostage, and continues to try to attack the heart and soul of our campaign, we will be in federal court this afternoon seeking an immediate injunction.What is required here is a full and independent audit of the DNC\u2019s handling of this data and its security from the beginning of this campaign to the present, including the incident in October that we alerted them to.", "author": "Bernie"}

Bernie Sanders told seniors at a community center here on Tuesday that more than half of workers nearing retirement have no savings so protecting Social Security is a top priority. He also called for reining in runaway prescription drug prices and stopping cuts to Medicare.\u201cMillions of seniors including many in New Hampshire and Vermont are struggling just to keep their heads above water,\u201d Sanders told the crowd of 150 people, mostly seniors. \u201cNot only will I oppose any efforts to cut Social Security benefits. What we are going to do is expand Social Security benefits.\u201dSocial Security is a key source of income for 42,000 people in New Hampshire whose benefits last year averaged about $15,000. Without Social Security, more than 41 percent of the elderly in New Hampshire would be living in poverty. With Social Security, the elderly poverty rate in New Hampshire is 5.7 percent.Under current law, the payroll taxes which fund the retirement program are capped at $118,500. Under Sanders\u2019 proposal, the wealthiest Americans who make more than $250,000 annually would pay the same share of their income as everyone else. Lifting the payroll tax cap would only raise taxes on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of Americans. The new revenue would expand Social Security benefits by an average of $65 a month, increase cost-of-living adjustments and boost benefits for low-income beneficiaries.\u201cSenior citizens with an income of less than $16,000 would see their benefits go up by more than $1,300 a year. Very low-income seniors who put in a lifetime of work would see their benefits go up even more,\u201d Sanders said.On prescription drugs, Sanders has introduced legislation to rein in prices that jumped more than 12 percent last year, the highest in a decade. \u201cAmericans should not have to live in fear that they will go bankrupt if they get sick. People should not have to go without the medication they need just because their elected officials aren\u2019t willing to challenge the drug and health care lobby,\u201d Sanders said.He noted that the pharmaceutical industry spent nearly $230 million on lobbying last year and employed more than 1,400 registered lobbyists.Legislation by Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland would authorize the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Their bills also would stiffen penalties for drug companies that commit fraud and lower barriers to the importation of less expensive drugs from Canada and other countries.Sanders has fought Republican efforts to end Medicare as we know it by turning it into a voucher program. \u201cInstead of cutting Medicare, instead of privatizing Medicare, instead of limiting the number of Americans who qualify for Medicare, we must join every other major nation on earth in recognizing that health care is a right, not a privilege and that right should be guaranteed to all, regardless of gender, income, age, or race,\u201d said Sanders, the Democrats\u2019 leader on the Senate Budget Committee.\n", "author": "Bernie"}

It also would double the number of Americans working in clean-energy jobs.Underscoring the urgency for bold action, Sanders said this year is on track to be the hottest on record and scientists are already predicting 2016 will be even hotter. Moreover, 13 of the 15 hottest years ever recorded have all occurred since 2000. The impact already is clear from shrinking ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to warming oceans and rising sea levels threatening communities around the world.Environmentalists have praised Sanders\u2019 plan as the boldest put forward by any candidate running for president.Watch Sanders speak about climate change in Iowa \u00bb", "author": "Bernie"}

HELENA ISLAND, S.C. \u2013 Speaking to 600 people packed inside the Penn Center\u2019s Darrah Hall, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday called for paid family leave for new parents and expanded benefits for seniors who rely on Social Security.Sanders is one of 19 Senate co-sponsors of the Family and Medical Leave Act introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Rep. Rosa DeLauro is the chief sponsor of a companion bill with 112 co-sponsors in the House.Under both measures, workers would be entitled to three months of paid leave to care for a newborn child. The legislation also calls for a small payroll tax totaling $1.38 a week for a typical worker.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton does not support Gillibrand\u2019s bill, aides have said. Sanders urged all presidential candidates to join him in supporting the legislation.The senator from Vermont also called on other White House hopefuls to join him in supporting a boost in benefits for retirees and the disabled.With Social Security recipients facing a coming year with no cost-of-living adjustment for inflation, Sanders\u2019 Social Security Expansion Act would make sure annual inflation adjustments are based on a formula that\u00a0better measures seniors\u2019 spending. Increasing medical costs and rising prices prescription drugs disproportionately impact seniors, Sanders told the audience here in South Carolina.Legislation he introduced in the Senate also would increase Social Security benefits and scrap a cap on income subject to the payroll tax. Now, someone making millions of dollars a year pays no more than someone making $118,500 a year. Levying the same tax rate on annual income greater than $250,000 would only impact the top 1.5 percent of wage earners while boosting benefits for millions of retirees.\u201cI would hope that every Democratic candidate for president of the United States is prepared to lift the cap and expand benefits for millions of seniors in this country who desperately need to see those benefits expanded,\u201d Sanders said.According to published reports, Clinton has not categorically ruled out benefit cuts including an increase in the retirement age.Sen. Sanders\u2019 plan to expand and extend Social Security would boost the income of a typical senior making less than $16,000 a year by about $1,300 a year. It would also make sure that Social Security could pay every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 50 years.", "author": "Bernie"}

Bernie Sanders and warning signs on Hillary Clinton\u2019s general election prospects should she win the nomination, according to a memorandum by polling and strategic consulting expert Ben Tulchin. Significantly, Sanders fares better than Clinton in many head-to-head matchups with leading Republicans.The independent surveys show the senator from Vermont continues to close the gap with the former secretary of state while voters\u2019 familiarity with Sanders and his favorability ratings are steadily rising, Sanders\u2019 pollster said. Moreover, Sanders\u2019 agenda has dominated the debate. His message about a rigged economy propped up by a corrupt campaign finance system \u201cis driving the issue agenda within the Democratic primary,\u201d Tulchin wrote.Looking ahead to next year\u2019s general election, Sanders is much more popular than Clinton with independents and he is much better positioned with Republicans, factors Tulchin said raise \u201creal questions as to which of these leading Democratic candidates is in fact the best positioned for the general election.\u201dIn several recent surveys Sanders outperformed Clinton in matchups with Republicans. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released on Nov. 3, Sanders outpolled Donald Trump by nine points, 50 percent to 41 percent, and the Vermont senator beat Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida by five points, 46 percent to 41 percent. In a McClatchy/Marist poll released Nov. 13, Sanders outpolled Donald Trump, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina. Sanders outperformed Clinton against Cruz and Bush. In a new poll in Colorado, Sanders fared better than Clinton when pitted against four leading Republican White House hopefuls. Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll, said Clinton \u201cwould get bruised and beaten by all the top GOP opponents, and absolutely crushed\u201d by Rubio or Carson.With the first primaries and caucuses less than three months away, the survey findings warn that Clinton \u201chas real vulnerabilities within the Democratic primary electorate,\u201d particularly for \u201cbeing too close to special interests and Wall Street.\u201dThe analysis of recent polls for CBS News, NBC News, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal underscored the fact that Sanders has closed the gap with Clinton since he declared his candidacy on April 30. Half a year ago, Sanders barely registered in polls and pundits dismissed his chances. Today, Sanders \u201chas made tremendous progress and is now the leading Democratic challenger to Hillary Clinton and within striking distance of her,\u201d according to the memo.Nationally, Sanders trailed by 30 points in a New York Times/CBS News poll in September (58 percent to 28 percent) but trailed by only 19 points (52 percent to 33 percent) in the latest survey. In fact, Sanders gained a net 5 points on Hillary over the past month, a period one published report declared \u201cthe best month ever\u201d for Clinton.In Iowa and New Hampshire, the states with the first caucuses and primary elections next February, the survey show that the more people know about Sanders the better they like him. \u201cThe bottom line is that as Democratic primary voters in key early voting states become more familiar with Sanders, they very much like what they hear and are much more likely to vote for him, thereby putting Sanders on a trajectory to make the Democratic primary horserace even more competitive as he campaigns aggressively and begins to advertise to get his message out more broadly.,\u201d the pollster wrote.To put the numbers in historical context, then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2007 trailed Clinton by 27 points at the same stage of that campaign. A Gallup Poll released on Nov. 16, 2007, put her ahead with 48 percent of the vote to Obama\u2019s 21 percent.", "author": "Bernie"}

Bernie Sanders on Wednesday backed legislation to ban new leases to mine or drill for fossil fuels on public land and urged other presidential candidates to join the fight against global warming.Sanders cosponsored the Keep it in the Ground Act to stop issuing new leases to mine or drill for oil, coal, and gas on public land in the West and in the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans.\u201cMy hope is that all presidential candidates will join Sen. Merkley and Sen. Warren and others in fighting for this legislation and standing up to the fossil fuel industry,\u201d Sanders said in a video distributed by his presidential campaign.\u201cIt\u2019s imperative that we not just talk the talk but walk the walk, that the United States lead the world in combating climate change,\u201d Sanders said.Sanders also had a message for Republicans in Congress who have blocked proposals to address climate change. \u201cWorry less about your campaign contributions and worry more about your children and grandchildren,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are taking on the Koch brothers and some of the most powerful political forces in the world who are more concerned with short-term profits than the future of the planet. I\u2019ve got four kids, and I\u2019ve got seven beautiful grandchildren. We have a moral responsibility to leave our kids a planet that is healthy and habitable.\u201dThe bill by Merkley, Sanders and other senators would keep more than 90 percent of the potential carbon emissions from fossil fuels on our federal lands and federal waters underground forever.At the news conference, Sanders also told reporters he believes that President Barack Obama should reject the Keystone XL oil pipeline before an international meeting in Paris next month on a global climate agreement. He said rejecting the pipeline would show \u201cbold leadership\u201d in the fight to prevent \u201ca major, major, major planetary crisis.\u201d The proposed pipeline would carry some of the dirtiest oil on the planet from Canada\u2019s tar sands region to refineries along the Gulf of Mexico in Texas.Watch the video here.", "author": "Bernie"}

Bernie Sanders called for strengthening Social Security, raising retirement benefits and bringing down skyrocketing prescription drug prices.Sanders told the gathering at the William B. Cashin Senior Activity Center that the most effective way to strengthen Social Security for the future is to make millionaires and billionaires pay the same share of their income as everyone else. Instead of capping income subject to the payroll tax at $118,500, as current law does, Sanders would make those earning $250,000 and up, the top 1.5 percent of wage earners, pay the same share into Social Security.In New Hampshire, more than 42,000 seniors, orphans and disabled people rely on Social Security benefits, which last year averaged $14,987. Without Social Security, more than 41 percent of the elderly in New Hampshire, including more than 45 percent of senior women, would be living in poverty. With Social Security, the elderly poverty rate in New Hampshire is 5.7 percent.Sanders has proposed legislation which would increase benefits by an average of $65 a month and lift low-income seniors out of poverty by expanding the minimum benefit. It also would base annual inflation adjustments on a formula that accurately measures the real-life spending patterns of seniors who pay a disproportionate amount of their income on health care and prescription drugs. To pay for the increased benefits, he would gradually scrap the cap on income subject to the payroll tax.While he would strengthen the retirement program for future generations, Sanders stressed that Social Security has a $2.8 trillion surplus, enough to pay every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 19 years.Sanders visited the senior center two days after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in remarks at St. Anselm\u2019s College, reportedly declined to back an across-the-board benefit boost, left open the possibility of raising the retirement age and stopped short of saying the wealthiest wage earners should pay the same percent of their income as everyone else.", "author": "Bernie"}

Bernie Sanders told a nationwide meeting of college students on Wednesday that he would take marijuana off the federal government\u2019s list of outlawed drugs.Speaking from George Mason University to 250 online student meetings in all 50 states, Sanders said he favors removing marijuana from the list of controlled substances regulated by federal law.\u201cIn the United States we have 2.2 million people in jail today, more than any other country. And we\u2019re spending about $80 billion a year to lock people up. We need major changes in our criminal justice system \u2013 including changes in drug laws,\u201d Sanders said.\u201cToo many Americans have seen their lives destroyed because they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use. That\u2019s wrong. That has got to change,\u201d he added. Under the senator\u2019s proposal, people in states which legalize marijuana no longer would be subject to federal prosecution for using pot. Owners of stores that sell marijuana could fully participate in the banking system, like any other business.States which want to regulate marijuana would remain free to do so the same way local laws now govern sales of alcohol and tobacco. Sanders, a candidate for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, would continue to allow federal law enforcement officials to arrest and prosecute drug dealers for trafficking in marijuana sales.Highlighting the proposal as part of a criminal justice reform agenda, Sanders noted that there were 620,000 marijuana possession arrests in 2014. That\u2019s one a minute, according to The Washington Post.Sanders pointed to marijuana arrests as another example of the disparate treatment of African-Americans by the criminal justice system. Although about the same proportion of blacks and whites use marijuana, a black person is almost four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white person, the American Civil Liberties Union found. According to the ACLU report, there were more than 8 million marijuana arrests in the United States from 2001 to 2010, and almost 9 in 10 were for possession. State governments spent $3.6 billion enforcing marijuana possession laws in 2010, the most recent year in the study.Arrests for marijuana possession rose nationwide last year even as Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize the use of marijuana, followed by Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia. The legalization movement may spread next year when marijuana decriminalization advocates plan to put the question to voters on ballots in Nevada, Arizona and California.A 2012 estimate calculated that about 20,000-30,000 people are in prison on marijuana possession alone.", "author": "Bernie"}

Bernie Sanders on Monday laid out his plan to address college costs and bring down student loan interest rates.Sanders discussed his college affordability plan after fielding a question from a student who said she had to take out a $20,000 loan at an 8 percent interest rate.The senator from Vermont and candidate for the Democratic Party presidential nomination has proposed legislation to cover tuition costs for qualified students at public colleges and universities. He also wants to substantially lower interest rates on student loans.Iowa was a national leader in providing a universal high school education for all students in the first half of the 20th century when public secondary schools saw a rapid increase in enrollment. That movement made a high school diploma the ticket to a solid, middle-class job.\u201cIn the year 2015, now is the time to extend that idea to colleges and universities,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat is why I am fighting for free tuition at public colleges and universities. The world has changed. We are living in a highly competitive global economy and for us to succeed we need the best educated workforce in the world.\u201dSanders\u2019 legislation would also overhaul student loan programs so students and their parents could reduce crushing debt loads. Federal profits on loans would be eliminated, work-study programs expanded and incentives offered for colleges and universities to keep costs down.The federal portion of Sanders\u2019 proposal would be offset by imposing a tax on Wall Street transactions by investment houses, hedge funds and other speculators.More than 1,000 economists have endorsed a tax on Wall Street speculation and today some 40 countries throughout the world \u2013 including Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, and China \u2013 have imposed a similar tax.To read more about Sanders college affordability plan, click here.", "author": "Bernie"}

Sanders\u2019 legislation would also increase Social Security benefits and scrap a cap on income subject to the payroll tax. Now, someone making millions of dollars a year pays no more than someone making $118,500 a year. Levying the same tax rate on annual income greater than $250,000 would only impact the top 1.5 percent of wage earners while boosting benefits for millions of retirees.Sanders highlighted how Social Security helps Iowans.\u201cWhile Social Security is taken for granted today, let us remember that before it was signed into law nearly half of senior citizens in Iowa were living in poverty. Today, while much too high, the senior poverty rate in Iowa is 6.4 percent,\u201d Sanders said.More than 616,000 people in Iowa \u2013 nearly 20 percent of the population \u2013 received $9 billion in Social Security benefits last year. The benefits went to more than 430,000 seniors, 78,000 people with disabilities and more than 38,000 Iowa children. Social Security last year lifted more than 228,000 Iowans out of poverty.\u201cAt a time when the average Social Security benefit is just $1,328 a month and more than two-thirds of the elderly population rely on Social Security for more than half of their income, our job must be to expand, not cut, Social Security,\u201d Sanders said.He said Republican White House hopefuls like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have proposed raising the retirement age to 69 or 70 and slashing Social Security benefits.\u201cI have a hard time understanding what world these Republicans and their billionaire campaign contributors live in,\u201d Sanders said. He cited reports that more than half of workers between the ages of 55 and 64 have no retirement savings at all. And only 1 in 5 Americans has a traditional pension.\n(function(d, s, id) { \u00a0var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; \u00a0if (d.getElementById(id)) return; \u00a0js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"\nfjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\nA couple of weeks ago, the United States government made a decision that will negatively impact almost 70 million elderly, disabled veterans, and people with disabilities in this country.Posted by Bernie Sanders on Friday, October 23, 2015", "author": "Bernie"}

{"url": "https://berniesanders.com/press-release/sanders-breaking-up-big-banks-restoring-glass-steagall-are-key-wall-street-reforms/", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has a long history of standing up to Wall Street, on Thursday pressed for critical reforms that he said must include breaking up of too-big-to-fail banks and restoring the Glass-Steagall Act, the 1930s law which separated commercial and investment banking.\u201cGiven the image of big banks today, it is easy now to take on Wall Street. I was there when it was not so popular,\u201d Sanders said. Sanders this year introduced legislation to break up too-big-to-fail financial institutions. He also is a co-sponsor of legislation by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to reinstate Glass-Steagall. As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, Sanders fought the push to deregulate Wall Street by then-Treasury Secretaries Lawrence Summers and Robert Rubin and former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. In 1999, Sanders was one of only 57 Members of the House of Representatives who voted against the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that repealed Glass-Steagall.\u201cI was proud to lead the fight in the House against repealing the Glass-Steagall Act. I predicted then that such a massive deregulation of the financial services industry would seriously harm the economy. I would give anything to have been proven wrong about this, but unfortunately what happened to the economy during the financial collapse of 2008 was even worse than I predicted,\u201d Sanders said.During the House floor debate, Sanders warned that the measure \u201cwill lead to fewer banks and financial service providers; increased charges and fees for individual consumers and small businesses; diminished credit for rural America; and taxpayer exposure to potential losses should a financial conglomerate fail. It will lead to more mega-mergers; a small number of corporations dominating the financial service industry; and further concentration of economic power in our country.\u201dIn the Senate, Sanders in 2009 voted against the bailout of the biggest Wall Street financial institutions whose greed, recklessness and illegal behavior had plunged the nation\u2019s economy into a terrible recession. The nation\u2019s largest financial institutions put taxpayers on the hook for a $700 billion bailout and more than $16 trillion in virtually zero interest loans from the Federal Reserve. Today, three of the four largest financial institutions are bigger today than before they were bailed out.The six largest financial institutions in this country today (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) have assets of nearly $10 trillion, a figure equal to about 60 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product. Those six financial institutions issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards, over 35 percent of all mortgages, control 95 percent of all derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits in the United States.", "author": "Bernie"}

{"url": "https://berniesanders.com/press-release/sanders-spotlights-seniors-in-new-hampshire/", "text": "PORTSMOUTH, N.H. \u2013 Focusing on critical issues for seniors, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Friday blasted outrageous price spikes by drugmakers and pressed for Congress to pass his plan to strengthen and expand Social Security.In remarks prepared for a keynote speech at a Democratic Party dinner here, Sanders said Medicare must be allowed to negotiate with drug companies to bring down costs to consumers and taxpayers. He also said Americans who pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs should be allowed to purchase medicine from Canada and other countries.Sanders also called for strengthening and expanding Social Security and slammed Republican White House hopefuls who would dismantle the successful retirement and disability program.On prescription drugs, Sanders has introduced legislation to rein in prices that jumped more than 12 percent last year, the highest in a decade. \u201cAmericans should not have to live in fear that they will go bankrupt if they get sick. People should not have to go without the medication they need just because their elected officials aren\u2019t willing to challenge the drug and health care lobby,\u201d Sanders said. He noted that the pharmaceutical industry spent nearly $230 million on lobbying last year, $65 million more than any other industry, and employed more than 1,400 registered lobbyists.Legislation filed in the Senate by Sanders and by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) in the House would authorize the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. The bills also would stiffen penalties for drug companies that commit fraud and lower barriers to the importation of less expensive drugs from Canada and other countries.Sanders and Cummings also have questioned spiraling prices for generic drugs, including a 62-year-old drug Daraprim that recently shot up in price from $13.50 a tablet to $750 a tablet before public outcry forced the drugmaker to back down.On Social Security, Sanders said the successful program has a $2.8 trillion surplus and will be able to pay all benefits promised to every eligible recipient until 2033.In New Hampshire, Social Security lifted 90,000 people out of poverty in 2013. The average Social Security benefit was $14,987 in 2014. Without Social Security, more than 41 percent of the elderly in New Hampshire, including more than 45 percent of senior women, would be living in poverty. With Social Security, the elderly poverty rate in New Hampshire is just 5.1 percent.Sanders said the most effective way to strengthen Social Security for the future is to make millionaires and billionaires pay the same share of their income as everyone else. Instead of capping income subject to the payroll tax at $118,500, as current law does, Sanders would make those earning $250,000 and up, the top 1.5 percent of wage earners, pay the same share into Social Security.Republican presidential candidates have their own plans for Social Security. They would cut benefits. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham all have suggested raising the retirement age and cut benefits. Proposals to privatize the system have been advanced by many of those candidates and by Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.To read what Republican candidates say about Social Security, click here.To read more about Sen.

At one point, it drove 180 contributions through our platform per minute,\u201d said Erin Hill, executive director of ActBlue, the fundraising firm. \u201cOver its 11-year history ActBlue has sent money to over eleven-thousand campaigns and committees \u2014 and the Bernie Sanders campaign holds the record for the two biggest donor days ever for a campaign on our platform.\u201dThe reaction was to the attempt by David Brock of the Clinton super PAC to link Sanders and Chavez. The \u201cconnection\u201d was that Sanders and former Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) worked together to help provide Vermonters and other low-income New England residents with affordable home heating oil supplied by the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, CITGO.\u201cFrankly what the Clinton Super PAC is doing is nothing new. It\u2019s the same-old, same-old negative politics that has gone on for years: throw mud and hope some of it sticks,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cWe are fighting for a different kind of politics. Instead of hurling dishonest or out-of-context charges, we are trying to run an issue-oriented campaign \u2013 focusing on the most important concerns of the American people.\u201dSanders said he looks forward to debating the regulation of Wall Street, trade policies, health care, college costs, climate change, Social Security and other important issues. \u201cThose are important issues where honest people can have legitimate disagreements. Let\u2019s have that debate, but let\u2019s not throw mud and continue playing the political games that have turned off millions of Americans,\u201d Sanders wrote.", "author": "Bernie"}

Bernie Sanders took to Twitter at #DebateWithBernie to take on the White House hopefuls for ignoring critical issues.\u201cRich get richer. Median family income $5k less than in 1999. One of the highest rates of childhood poverty. Any discussion?\u201d he asked as the debate droned on. \u201cHave you heard anyone use the word poverty yet? 47.7 million Americans living in poverty. No discussion.\u201d Still later he tweeted: \u201cWaiting, waiting, waiting. Will we hear anything about racial justice, income inequality or making college affordable?\u201dNearly two hours into the debate, the conversation briefly turned to an important issue: raising the $7.25 hourly minimum wage. \u201cThe American people overwhelmingly want to raise the minimum wage. Too bad the Republicans don\u2019t,\u201d Sanders tweeted. He has introduced legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020.During a back-and-forth on foreign policy, Sanders asked, \u201cGee. How come these guys are not talking about the great \u2018success\u2019 of Bush\u2019s foreign policy and the war in Iraq?\u201d A few minutes later he wondered, \u201cCan these guys talk about anything other than their desire to go to war?\u201d During a discussion about a proposed deal to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, Sanders wrote, \u201cWar, war, war. When do we get to their other major priority: tax breaks for billionaires?\u201dMissing from the exchanges was perhaps the greatest international crisis facing the planet. \u201cWill they talk about climate change as a foreign policy issue? Or talk about it at all?\u201d They finally did. It turned out that not one of them believes that the United States government should lead the world in combating climate change and transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels.On domestic issues, Republicans wanted to take away health care for women and marriage rights from gays.The candidates were asked about a Kentucky county clerk defying a court order and refusing to issue marriage licenses to gays. \u201cDoes anybody on the stage believe that our gay brothers and sisters have the same rights as the rest of us?\u201d Sanders wondered. \u201cAnybody?\u201dThe Republicans also called for defunding Planned Parenthood. \u201cDoes anyone on that stage believe the women of this country have the right to control their own bodies? Anyone?\u201d Sanders asked.Some of Sanders\u2019 most popular tweets were about Republican front-runner Donald Trump. \u201cTrump: \u2018I will take care of women.\u2019 Really? What about respecting the right of women to control their own bodies?\u201d Sanders said. As the front-runner smirked and ridiculed his challengers, Sanders said of Trump: \u201cWhat a pleasant and humble person. Can\u2019t stop saying kind and generous things about his fellow Republicans.\u201dSanders gave up after more than two and a half hours. \u201cThank you all. I\u2019ve had it. I\u2019m going home. Talk to you soon.\u201d He ended the night with a Facebook post: \u201cThe evening was really pretty sad. This country and our planet face enormous problems. And the Republican candidates barely touched upon them tonight. And when they did, they were dead wrong on virtually every position they took. The Republican Party cannot be allowed to lead this country. That\u2019s why we need a political revolution.\u201d", "author": "Bernie"}

Bernie Sanders for an address on Monday at Liberty University:\u201cI came here today because I believe that it is important for those with different views in our country to engage in civil discourse \u2013 not just to shout at each other or make fun of each other. It is very easy for those in politics to talk to those who agree with us. I do that every day. It is harder, but not less important, to try to communicate with those who do not agree with us and see where, if possible, we can find common ground and, in other words, to reach out of our zone of comfort.\u201cLiberty University is a religious school. It is a school which tries to understand the meaning of morality and the words of the Bible within the context of a very complicated modern world. It is a school which tries to teach its students how to behave with decency and honesty and how to best relate to their fellow human beings. I applaud those goals.\u201cSo let me take a few moments to tell you what motivates me in the work that I do as a public servant and as an elected official. I am far, far from a perfect human being but I am motivated by a vision which exists in all of the great religions \u2013 Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism and others \u2013 and which is so beautifully and clearly stated in Matthew 7:12. \u2018So in everything, do to others what you would have them to do to you, for this sums up the Law and the prophets.\u2019 The Golden Rule. Do to others what you would have them do to you. Not very complicated.\u201cLet me be very frank. I understand that issues such as abortion and gay marriage are very important to you and that we disagree on those issues. I get that. But let me respectfully suggest that there are other issues out there that are of enormous consequence to our country and the world and that maybe, just maybe, we don\u2019t disagree on them. And maybe, just maybe, we can work together in trying to resolve them.\u201cIt would, I think, be hard for anyone in this room to make the case that the United States today is a just society or anything close to a just society. In America today, there is massive injustice in terms of income and wealth inequality. Injustice is rampant.\u201cThere is no justice when the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.

Bernie Sanders stated today that the United States needs major reforms to our broken criminal justice system, and that a good step forward would be to end the practice of prisons in America being run by private corporations. He will soon introduce legislation to do just that.Of the nearly 1.6 million people in federal and state prisons in 2013, 133,044 (8.4 percent) were in private prisons. That included 41,150 federal inmates in private facilities (19.1 percent of all federal prisoners) and 91,885 state prisoners in private facilities (6.8 percent of total state inmates). Most of the individuals detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement also are in private detention facilities.\u201cIt is clear to most Americans that we need major reforms in our broken criminal justice system,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe need to end the tragic reality that the United States has more people in jail than any other country on earth, and that the people being incarcerated are disproportionately black and Hispanic. We need to take a hard look at why the rate of recidivism in this country is so high and why we are not developing successful paths back to civil society for those who serve prison time. Further we need to end, once and for all, the disgraceful practice of corporations profiting from the incarceration of Americans.\u201cAs a nation, our goal must be to do everything we can to create the conditions that prevent mass incarceration. At a time when we are spending $50 billion a year on our correctional system, it makes a lot more sense to me to be investing in jobs and education for our young people than in more and more jails. Not only can we prevent thousands of lives from being destroyed, we can save billions of taxpayer dollars. Locking people up is a lot more expensive than schools,\u201d Sanders said.\u201cOverall, we need bold change in our criminal justice system. A good first step forward is to start treating prisoners as human beings, not profiting from their incarceration. Our emphasis must be on rehabilitation, not incarceration and longer prison sentences. The basic decisions regarding criminal justice and public safety are, without a doubt, the responsibility of the citizens of our country and not the investors in private corporations.\u201cMy legislation will eliminate federal, state and local contracts for privately run prisons within 2 years. It will reinstate the federal parole system. It will increase oversight and eliminate the overcharging of prisoners by private companies for banking and other services. It will end the mandatory quota of immigrants detained. It will require ICE to improve the monitoring of detention facilities and eliminate private detention centers within 2 years.\u201dSanders will be introducing this bill next week.", "author": "Bernie"}

Bernie Sanders on Monday said organized labor fought overwhelming odds and \u201cchanged society\u201d by securing a 40-hour work week, workplace safety standards and the minimum wage. During a keynote speech to the New Hampshire AFL-CIO, Sanders laid out a bold agenda to help working families today.\u201cWorking people and their unions fought for a more responsive democracy and built the middle class,\u201d Sanders said in prepared remarks. \u201cToday we can and we must follow their example. It\u2019s time to rebuild the crumbling middle class of our country and make certain that every working person in the United States of America has a chance at a decent life.\u201d\u201cAt a time when almost all new income and wealth is going to the people on top while millions of Americans work longer hours for lower wages,\u201d he said, \u201cthe time is long overdue for us to create an economy which works for the middle class and working families of this country, and not just the 1 percent.\u201dToday, the Democratic candidate for president said, workers in the United States must be guaranteed paid medical and family leave and paid sick time and vacation time. With real unemployment at more than 10 percent, Sanders proposed a $1 trillion program to rebuild America\u2019s crumbling roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects and create 13 million decent-paying jobs.With too many workers making \u201cstarvation wages,\u201d Sanders said the $7.25 hourly federal minimum wage should be more than doubled to $15 an hour by 2020.When many businesses are making it harder for workers to form a union, Sanders said Congress should enact the Employee Free Choice Act to let workers who want to organize join a union. When millions of manufacturing jobs have been lost to low-wage countries overseas because of job-killing trade policies, Sanders said Congress must defeat a corporate-backed proposal for a new Pacific Rim trade deal.He also called for pay equity for women workers, tuition-free public colleges and universities funded with a tax on Wall Street speculators, a Medicare-for-all health care system and an expansion of Social Security.At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, Sanders also said our tax system must demand that the wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share.\u201cThe economic reality is that while our economy today is much stronger than when President George W. Bush left office seven years ago, the middle class is continuing its 40-year decline,\u201d Sanders said. Wages fell for 90 percent of Americans between 2009 and 2012 but rose for the top 10 percent.\u201cIn the wealthiest country in the history of the world we can accomplish all these goals, but we can\u2019t do it without a political revolution. We can\u2019t do it unless millions of Americans stand up and fight back to reclaim our country from the hands of a billionaire class whose greed is destroying our nation,\u201d Sanders said.", "author": "Bernie"}

I would have hoped that by the year 2015 leading candidates for president like Mr. Trump would campaign on their ideas as to how they can address our serious problems, and not by trying to divide the country with racist and demagogic appeals. Clearly Trump is scapegoating the Hispanic community. Immigrants are not responsible,\u201d Sanders stressed, \u201cfor the disappearing American middle class, the Wall Street collapse brought on by huge financial institutions\u2019 greed and illegal behavior, the war in Iraq, income inequality or climate change.\u201d At the roundtable discussion, Sanders called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cmean\u201d and \u201cdenigrating\u201d to an entire group of people and accused him of using Latinos as \u201cwhipping boys\u201d to distract attention from real problems confronting the country. He called it \u201cabsurd, racist and wrong\u201d to blame immigrants for the nation\u2019s problems.\u201cThat is absolutely unacceptable,\u201d the senator added during the roundtable discussion at the Muscatine County Boxing Club. \u201cThat kind of discourse should be removed from our politics.\u201dIn recent weeks, Trump has proposed the mass deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. as well as their American-born children. He called for amending the Constitution to end automatic citizenship for children born to immigrants living illegally in the U.S. He has denounced immigrants from Mexico and other Central American nations as \u201creally bad.\u201d He also has vilified immigrants from Latin America in general as responsible for \u201cbringing drugs, bringing crime\u201d into the U.S. He also has branded them as \u201crapists.\u201dWatch the video: ", "author": "Bernie"}

That increase was more than double the rise in overall medical costs.\u201cAmericans should not have to live in fear that they will go bankrupt if they get sick. People should not have to go without the medication they need just because their elected officials aren\u2019t willing to challenge the drug and health care industry lobby,\u201d Sanders said. The pharmaceutical industry last year doled out almost $230 million to lobby Congress.Sanders, a senator from Vermont, said he will introduce legislation to let the Department of Health and Human Services negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Using the buying power of the federal government to get better deals on drug prices for taxpayers and seniors on Medicare would dramatically lower the costs.Sanders also proposed tough new penalties for drug companies that commit fraud. \u201cWe should pass legislation which says that drug companies lose their government-backed monopoly on a drug if they are found guilty of fraud in the manufacture or sale of that drug,\u201d Sanders said.To encourage wider availability of more affordable generic drugs, Sanders said Congress should ban the practice of brand-name drugmakers paying potential competitors to keep lower-priced generic substitutes off the market. Brand-name drugs cost, on average, 10 times as much as generics.Sanders also would lower barriers to the importation of lower-cost drugs from other countries like Canada, where he once took a busload of Vermonters to purchase a prescription breast cancer drug at a fraction of the cost charged in the United States for the same medicine.In separate legislation, Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) last May introduced legislation that would make companies pay rebates to the Medicaid program if generic prices grew faster than inflation.\u201cBetween our government\u2019s unwillingness to negotiate prices and its failure to effectively fight fraud, it\u2019s no wonder drug prices are out of control. We have got to make sure that everyone in this country can afford the prescription drugs that they need to live healthy lives,\u201d Sanders said.", "author": "Bernie"}

He spoke of \u201cthe sickness of a man who can walk into a Bible study class in Charleston and then take out a gun and kill nine people.\u201d\u201cAs president of the United States,\u201d Sanders told the North Charleston audience, \u201cnobody will fight harder to end institutional racism and to reform our broken criminal justice system.\u201dHe also cited the case of Walter Scott, a 50-year-old black man killed last spring after a traffic stop by a North Charleston police officer later charged with murder. Scott is among too many African-Americans, Sanders said, who \u201cdied unnecessarily at the hands of police officers or in police custody. That must change,\u201d he added.On another critical issue in South Carolina, Sanders said 27 percent of the state\u2019s children live in poverty and of those 300,000 children, 138,000 are black, 95,000 are white and 34,000 are Hispanic. \u201cThis issue of childhood poverty impacts every race and we\u2019ve got to stand together to change it,\u201d Sanders said.On health care, he said it was \u201ctragically wrong\u201d for Gov.

He advocated raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020, more than double the $7.25 an hour under current law. He urged men to stand with women for pay equity.Shedding his suit coat and rolling up his shirt sleeves, Sanders also made the case against a proposed Pacific Rim trade deal. A leading opponent in Congress of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, Sanders said the corporate-backed agreement which is uniformly opposed by labor would continue a string of disastrous trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement and others which have destroyed millions of decent-paying jobs in the United States.\u201cDuring my 24 years in Congress, I have been proud to stand side by side with the AFL-CIO fighting to increase the minimum wage; fighting to guarantee health care to every man, woman and child as a right of citizenship; fighting to make it easier for workers to join unions; fighting to create millions of jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; fighting for pay equity for women workers; fighting for paid family and medical leave; fighting to expand, not cut, Social Security,\u201d Sanders said in prepared remarks.At a news conference afterward, Sanders told reporters he agrees with the AFL-CIO effort to eliminate the excise tax on health benefits union workers earned in collective bargaining agreements.He also spoke about the gains labor unions have helped achieve for working families.\u201cWhen only the wealthy were allowed to vote, the trade union movement was successful in demanding universal suffrage and a more democratic society. When tiny children were forced to work in the factories and fields, it was the trade union movement who put an end to abusive child labor and who fought for quality public education. When bosses refused to negotiate with their workers and fired them for standing up for their rights, the trade union movement pushed Congress into passing legislation which guaranteed all people the right to organize unions and collectively bargain for better wages and benefits.\u201cThe list goes on. Social Security, the minimum wage, Medicare and Medicaid, affordable housing \u2013 are just a few of the benefits that workers have won over the years thanks in large part to the trade union movement,\u201d Sanders said.After speaking at the labor convention, Sanders headed to Reno for a rally at the University of Nevada expected to draw a crowd of several thousand supporters. \u201cHow come people are coming out?\u201d he asked before answering his own question. \u201cBecause they\u2019ve had it up to here.\u201dThis is the third time this year that Sanders has visited Nevada, one of the first states to hold caucuses to begin the process of selecting the Democratic Party nominee for president.To read the senator\u2019s prepared remarks at the AFL-CIO, click here.", "author": "Bernie"}
{"url": "https://berniesanders.com/press-release/chicago-feels-the-bern/", "text": "CHICAGO \u2013 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Monday brought his call for a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d to a crowd of more than 820 people packed inside a historic theater here on the Windy City\u2019s North Side.Earlier Monday, the U.S. senator from Vermont visited the South Side headquarters of Operation PUSH for a meeting with the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr. Long-time friends, the senator and the civil rights leader held a very productive, hour-long meeting on important issues confronting the country and the African-American community.Civil rights and criminal justice reform were among the key topics Sanders addressed in remarks at the Park West theater. \u201cAs somebody who has one of the strongest civil rights records in Congress, no one will fight harder to end institutional racism in this country and, equally important, reform the criminal justice system,\u201d Sanders said.He said he will soon propose legislation to stop private corporations from making money on the incarceration of prisoners. He also called for reforming sentencing laws and providing better ways for those in prison to return to society.\u201cWe are going to end this horrendous distinction of having more people in jail than any other country on earth and instead work to create the best-educated population on earth,\u201d Sanders added. \u201cIn my view, it makes a hell of a lot more sense to be investing in jobs and education instead of jails and incarceration.\u201dA spotlight beamed on Sanders at center stage as he thanked the standing-room-only crowd for joining him in \u201cfighting for a country that belongs to all of us and not just a handful of billionaires.\u201dThe event was a small-dollar fundraiser with tickets starting at $50. It was only the fifth formal fundraiser in the nearly four months since Sanders launched his campaign last spring. Since then, more than 350,000 supporters have donated to his campaign. Unlike other candidates who have relied on Super PACs and the unlimited donations they can take from wealthy donors, Sanders said the average donation to his campaign so far is $31.20.\u201cWe are seeing in America today a campaign finance system which is corrupt,\u201d he said of the campaign funding mechanism created by a disastrous 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which opened the floodgates to unlimited spending by corporations and wealthy individuals.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in the agenda of corporate America. I don\u2019t believe in the agenda of the billionaire class. And I don\u2019t want their money,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut at the end of the day money doesn\u2019t always win. What we are showing is that millions of people agree with us.\u201dSanders was introduced by Cook County Commissioner Jes\u00fas G. \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda, 10th Ward Ald. Susan Sadlowski Garza, 35th Ward Ald.

{"url": "https://berniesanders.com/press-release/sanders-calls-for-strengthening-social-security/", "text": "BOONE, Iowa \u2013 Eighty years after Social Security was signed into law, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday called for strengthening and expanding the retirement and disability program and slammed Republican White House hopefuls who would dismantle Social Security.Sanders outlined his legislation during a town hall meeting here at the Boone County Fairgrounds. He also planned to talk about Republican attacks on the program at The Des Moines Register\u2019s State Fair Soapbox.\u201cSocial Security is the most successful government program in our nation\u2019s history. Through good times and bad, Social Security has paid out every benefit owed to every eligible American,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe most effective way to strengthen Social Security for the future is to make millionaires and billionaires pay the same share as everyone else.\u201dRepublican presidential candidates have floated proposals to cut Social Security. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham all have suggested raising the retirement age. Proposals to privatize the system have been advanced by many of those candidates and by Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.\u201cIt is unacceptable to ask construction workers, truck drivers, nurses and other working-class Americans to work until they are 68 to 70 years old before qualifying for full Social Security benefits,\u201d Sanders said.In Iowa, more than 616,000 people (19.8 percent of the population) received $9 billion in Social Security benefits last year. This includes more than 430,000 seniors, 78,000 people with disabilities and more than 38,000 Iowa children.Social Security lifted 228,000 Iowans out of poverty in 2013. The average Social Security benefit was just $14,556 in 2014. Without Social Security, 47 percent of the elderly, including more than half of senior women in Iowa, would be living in poverty. With Social Security, the elderly poverty rate for Iowa is just 4.7 percent. For Iowa women it is 8.2 percent.In Washington, D.C., Sanders introduced legislation on March 12 to expand benefits and strengthen the retirement program for generations to come. Under current law, the amount of income subject to the payroll tax is capped at $118,500. That means someone making millions of dollars a year pays the same amount in payroll taxes as someone making $118,500 a year. Sanders would levy the payroll tax on all income over $250,000. That change would impact the top 1.5 percent of wage earners, according to the Center for Economic Policy Research.Having the wealthiest Americans contribute their fair share would extend the solvency of Social Security through 2065 and allow benefits to be expanded for millions of Americans. \u201cAt a time when over half of the American people have less than $10,000 in savings and senior poverty is increasing, we should not be talking about cutting Social Security benefits. We should be talking about expanding benefits to make sure that every American can retire with dignity,\u201d the senator said.Under the legislation, Social Security benefits would go up by about $65 a month for most recipients. Annual cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security recipients would increase and set a new minimum benefit to significantly reduce the senior poverty rate.President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act on Aug. 14, 1935.Social Security today has a $2.8 trillion surplus and will be able to pay all promised benefits until 2033, after which it will be able to pay around 75 percent of all promised benefits. Sanders\u2019 Social Security Expansion Act would increase revenue and extend the solvency of Social Security for the next 50 years.To read what Republican candidates say about Social Security, click here.", "author": "Bernie"}

The crowd roared its approval.And there were more thunderous cheers and applause when Sanders walked up a catwalk onto the stage and proclaimed, in a hoarse shout, that \u201cthis country belongs to all of us and not a handful of billionaires. We need a grassroots political revolution.\u201dLos Angeles Memorial Sports Arena officials said there were 27,500 people inside the arena and watching on giant TV screens in an overflow area outside. The tremendous turnout \u2013 five times bigger than the largest crowd any other presidential candidate has attracted \u2013 capped a three-day weekend of big rallies that drew 28,000 people to see Sanders in Portland, Oregon, on Sunday after 15,000 saw him in Seattle on Saturday.The rallies provided new hard evidence of a Sanders surge. \u201cThis is a campaign that is on the move,\u201d Sanders said, \u201cand, together, this is a campaign that will end in victory.\u201dHe spoke for about an hour about domestic and foreign policy issues.On foreign policy, Sanders reminded the audience that he voted against the war in Iraq. They cheered. Then he said he spoke with President Barack Obama last week and assured him that he will support an agreement with Iran to stop it from developing a nuclear weapon. There was more applause. But the audience really erupted when he added, \u201cWar has got to be the last recourse, not the first.\u201dHe was cheered when he called for public funding of campaigns. \u201cThis campaign is not a billionaire-funded campaign. It is a people campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take money from billionaires. We don\u2019t take money from corporations. Yet we have received more individual contributions than any other campaign. We don\u2019t have the money but when people stand together there is nothing we can\u2019t accomplish.\u201dAngelenos approved when Sanders congratulated the city for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. He has a Senate bill to put the federal hourly minimum wage at $15 by 2020. They applauded his call for a massive road and bridge project to rebuild America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and create 13 million good-paying jobs.Perhaps the biggest crowd reaction of the night came when he called for tuition-free public colleges and universities, something the University of California system once offered to qualified students.\u201cThe reason why we are doing well in this campaign is because we are telling the truth. We are talking to the reality of American life today. We are talking about a reality in which almost all of the wealth and income in this country is going to the top 1 percent. We are talking about the United States having more wealth and income inequality than any other major country on earth and we are going to change that.\u201d", "author": "Bernie"}

He has called, for example, for an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour and for pay equity for women.Sanders also stands out, added DeMoro, for his outspoken opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The proposed trade deal among 12 Pacific Rim nations, she noted, includes a handout to pharmaceutical giants that would further drive up prescription drug prices.And she cited the union\u2019s push for a Wall Street transactions tax, legislation he introduced to put a small fee on speculators and hedge funds to finance Sanders\u2019 proposal for tuition-free public colleges and universities.National Nurses United represents nurses from coast-to-coast and in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, three states that play a critical early role in the nominating process.To read Sanders\u2019 full prepared statement, click here.", "author": "Bernie"}

Consistently drawing bigger turnouts than any other presidential contender, Sanders told the packed Portland arena, \u201cYou\u2019ve done it better than anyone else.\u201d The arena seats were filled and thousands more listened to the speech on loudspeakers outside, according to Michael Lewellen, a Rose Quarter vice president. The total turnout far surpassed the 15,000 in Seattle just 24 hours earlier.The big and boisterous crowds, Sanders said, are sending a message that it\u2019s time to reverse the four-decade decline of the American middle class and launch a grassroots \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d to take on the billionaire class. \u201cBringing people together,\u201d Sanders added, is at the core of his campaign.Sanders also called for criminal justice reform. \u201cThere is no candidate who will fight harder to end institutional racism in this country and to reform our broken criminal justice system,\u201d he said.In the nearly hour-long speech, Sanders touched on economic and jobs proposals, criminal justice reform and civil rights issues.On domestic issues, the U.S. senator from Vermont advocated raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020, closing tax loopholes exploited by the wealthy and profitable corporations, undertaking a massive $1 trillion program to fix roads and bridges and create or sustain 13 million jobs, a Medicare-for-all health care system to provide better care for more people at less cost, an expansion of Social Security and tuition-free college.In an interview broadcast earlier Sunday on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Sanders had made the case for the agreement with Iran reached by President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to tell you that this is a perfect agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the United States has to negotiate with other countries.

It also would let candidates spend more time meeting voters and discussing issues and less time raising campaign funds. \u201cThat\u2019s called democracy and I am going to do everything I can to bring that about,\u201d Sanders said.Sanders spoke about campaign finances during an hour-long speech to about 300 people at a town meeting.

{"url": "https://berniesanders.com/press-release/sanders-addresses-southern-christian-leadership-conference/", "text": "BATON ROUGE, La. \u2013 U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Saturday that the \u201ccontinuing struggle for racial justice in America\u201d must confront the \u201chorrible facts\u201d of how African-Americans are treated by the criminal justice system in the United States.In remarks prepared for a Southern Christian Leadership Conference meeting here tonight, Sanders said one in four African-American males born today is likely to spend time behind bars. He called it an \u201cunspeakable tragedy\u201d that blacks are imprisoned at six times the rate of whites.He cited a Department of Justice study which found that blacks are three times more likely to be searched during a traffic stop than white motorists. He said African-Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and nearly four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with police.African-Americans make up two-fifths of all young people in prisons, he added. African-American women are three times more likely than white women to be incarcerated. Upon conviction for a crime, black offenders receive 10 percent longer sentences than whites for the same crimes. Minorities, moreover, are sentenced to death at significantly higher rates than whites, added Sanders, a capital punishment opponent.\u201cOf course the majority of people of color are trying to work hard, play by the rules and raise their children,\u201d Sanders added. \u201cBut there are neighborhoods where mothers are afraid to let their children outside for fear of gang violence and drugs. And they are also afraid of their children being targeted by the police because of the color of their skin. No person should have to worry that a routine interaction with law enforcement will end in violence or death.\u201dThe Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice, Sanders recalled. But today, the senator said, \u201ctoo many African-Americans and other minorities find themselves subjected to a system that treats citizens who have not committed crimes like criminals. A growing number of communities do not trust the police and police have become disconnected from the communities they are sworn to protect.\u201dHe cited the deaths in police custody of Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Rekia Boyd, Eric Garner, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice. \u201cWe know their names. Each of them died unarmed at the hands of police officers or in police custody. The chants are growing louder. People are angry; I am angry; and people have a right to be angry. Violence and brutality of any kind \u2013 particularly at the hands of law enforcement sworn to protect and serve our communities \u2013 is unacceptable and must not be tolerated,\u201d he said.\u201cBlack lives do matter,\u201d Sanders said in detailing a series of reforms. He called for shifting from militarized local police forces to more community policing like he put in place as the mayor of Burlington, Vermont. The federal government should help local law enforcement agencies reform how police officers are trained, he said, and body cameras should be provided for law enforcement agencies to create a record of police encounters with citizens. States and local governments should get more U.S. Justice Department grant support to encourage those initiatives, he said, but police departments which don\u2019t reform should have federal funding slashed.He said police and prosecutors should not be judged by how many people are locked away. For people whose crimes landed them in jail, there must be a path back from prison. There should be education and skills-training for those who are incarcerated. And prisons should not be packed with non-violent young Americans who do not pose a serious threat to our society. \u201cIt is an international embarrassment that we have more people locked up in jail than any other country on earth \u2013 more than even the Communist totalitarian state of China. That has got to end,\u201d Sanders said.Linking racial justice with economic justice, Sanders said minorities would benefit from programs to reduce poverty and lift up the middle class. He proposed, for example, raising the minimum hourly wage to $15, which he called for in a Senate bill introduced on Wednesday. He cited the need to pass a youth jobs bill, which he introduced with Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), and argued that putting millions of Americans back to work rebuilding roads and bridges would create millions of decent-paying jobs.King, the great civil rights leader, drew a connection between racial discrimination and economic issues. He cited King\u2019s view that the problem in the United States was structural. \u201cThis country has socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor,\u201d King once declared.To read the complete text of the prepared remarks, click here.", "author": "Bernie"}

Earlier in the day, another 8,000 Texans packed a Dallas hotel.At both appearances, Sanders discussed wealth and income inequality, the \u201cnational tragedy\u201d of youth unemployment, making college tuition-free, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and the need for a massive federal highway construction program to create millions of decent-paying jobs.He also questioned why the United States puts more people behind bars than any other nation. \u201cWhen we have so many of our young people in jail, to me it makes sense that we invest more in jobs and education rather than jails and incarceration,\u201d Sanders said.And here in Houston, Sanders brought up the death last Monday of Sandra Bland, a young African-American woman found dead in her Waller County jail cell 60 miles northwest of Houston. The 28-year-old from suburban Chicago had been arrested July 10 after a routine traffic stop. The medical examiner said her death was a suicide. Bland\u2019s family disputes the finding.\u201cI wish that in the year 2015, I could tell you that we have eliminated racism in our country but you all know that is not true,\u201d Sanders said.In citing the death of Bland, Sanders also mentioned other recent deaths of African-Americans in police custody. Eric Garner died one year ago after a New York City a police officer put him in a chokehold. Freddie Gray was a 25-year-old African-American who died last April while being transported in a Baltimore Police van. Tamir Rice was 12 years old when he was shot and killed in 2014 by two police officers in Cleveland, Ohio.\u201cThese are the cases that you have heard about recently but anyone who thinks this has not been going on decade after decade would be very wrong,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt is unacceptable that police officers beat up people or kill people. If they do that, they have got to be held accountable.\u201dAs a former mayor, Sanders said he worked with police. \u201cThe vast majority of police officers work hard. It is a very, very difficult job. But if a police officer breaks the law, that officer must be held accountable.\u201d", "author": "Bernie"}

Sanders was in the minority of lawmakers who voted against the so-called Defense of Marriage Act. The law signed by then-President Bill Clinton denied federal benefits to gays who were legally married.Sanders previously had voted in 1993 against the now-abandoned U.S. military policy which barred gays from serving openly in the armed forces. In 2010, he voted in the Senate to repeal the discriminatory policy known as \u201cDon\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell.\u201dSanders also supported Vermont\u2019s civil unions law in 2000, and he was an outspoken proponent of gay marriage before the Legislature in his home state in 2009 passed one of the nation\u2019s first same-sex marriage laws.On CNN, Sanders replied to a question about the Supreme Court ruling after Tapper noted, \u201cYou\u2019ve been way out in front when it comes to the rights of same-sex couples.\u201dSaid Sanders: \u201cMy view is that people have a right to love each other, regardless of one\u2019s sexual orientation. I voted against the DOMA Act, the so-called Defense of Marriage Act way back in 1996 that was signed by President Clinton, because I think if people are in love they should be able to get married in this country in 50 states in America. And I strongly support what the Supreme Court recently said,\u201d Sanders told CNN.Tapper asked the senator whether tax exemptions should be taken away from any organizations, including religious organizations, which do not recognize same-sex marriage. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I would go there. You know, we have religious freedom and I respect people who have different points of view.\u201dSanders\u2019 outspoken support for gay rights dates back to at least as long ago as 1983 when, as the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, he supported a then-controversial resolution designating that June 25 as Lesbian and Gay Pride Day. According to a recent report in the Vermont newspaper Seven Days, opposition to the proposal \u201cwas strong \u2014 and, in some instances, vitriolic,\u201d but Sanders indicated at the City Council meeting that he would sign the proclamation. \u201cIn the city of Burlington and in the state of Vermont, people have the right to exercise their lifestyles,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s an American right, anyone\u2019s right to have a march\u2026 This is a civil liberties question.\u201d", "author": "Bernie"}

Hard-working families coming to the United States to create a brighter future for their children. It is a story rooted in family and fueled by hope.

It is time to give them legal status.

I would hope very much that Secretary Clinton will side with every union in the country, virtually every environmental group and many religious groups and say that this TPP [Trans-Pacific Partnership] policy is a disaster, that it must be defeated and that we need to regroup and come up with a trade policy which demands that corporate America starts investing in this country rather than in countries all over the world,\u201d Sanders said on the CBS News program \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cI look forward to working with Secretary Clinton on this issue,\u201d he added.\u201cThere is no question that what our trade policy has been for many years is to allow corporate America to shut down plants in this country, move abroad, hire people at pennies an hour and then bring their products back to the United States.

Bernie\u2019s work on the environment was an inspiration to her, she said. It\u2019s also why she announced at the outset of the meeting that she is endorsing Sanders in New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary for the Democratic Party presidential nomination.The big turnout was evidence of a growing groundswell of support. \u201cThis is not about Bernie Sanders,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have the best president in the history of the world but that person will not be able to address the problems that we face unless there is a mass movement, a political revolution in this country. Right now the only pieces of legislation that get to the floor of the House and Senate are sanctioned by big money, Wall Street, the pharmaceutical companies.

I hope very much that we can begin with the Democratic candidate debates as early as July and have some Republicans in those debates as well,\u201d he said.Debates could help voters understand, for example, how candidates may differ on a proposed 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal now before Congress. Sanders opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership because he believes it would cause more U.S. manufacturing plants to close and result in the transfer of millions of jobs to low-wage nations like Vietnam, where the minimum wage is 58-cents an hour.Debates also could clarify where candidates stand on whether to promote the use of the dirtiest oil on the planet from Canada\u2019s tar sands region by constructing a pipeline to ship the crude oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries along the Gulf of Mexico. Sanders opposes the pipeline.Early debates involving both Democrats and Republicans also could revive interest among ordinary voters in the democratic process. One way to get disillusioned voters to participate in elections would be to make it clear that there are major differences between a progressive agenda and the reactionary platform of the Republican Party.

He said he will lead the effort in Congress to block a new 12-nation trade deal that would ship more American jobs to low-wage nations overseas. He called for raising the minimum wage eventually to $15 an hour from today\u2019s starvation wage of $7.25 an hour.

{"url": "https://berniesanders.com/press-release/sanders-launches-presidential-campaign-in-vermont/", "text": "U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday launched his campaign for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. In a speech at Waterfront Park before a crowd police estimated at more than 5,000 strong, Sanders laid out the serious challenges facing the country and detailed an \u201cAgenda for America\u201d calling for specific proposals to provide bold solutions.\u201cToday, with your support and the support of millions of people throughout this country, we begin a political revolution to transform our country economically, politically, socially and environmentally,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cToday, we stand here and say loudly and clearly that; \u2018Enough is enough. This great nation and its government belong to all of the people and not to a handful of billionaires, their Super PACs and their lobbyists.\u2019\u201cLet me be very clear,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is something profoundly wrong when the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and when 99 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. There is something profoundly wrong when, in recent years, we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires at the same time as millions of Americans work longer hours for lower wages and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on earth. There is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans. This grotesque level of inequality is immoral. It is bad economics. It is unsustainable. This type of rigged economy is not what America is supposed to be about. This has got to change and, as your president, together we will change it.\u201dIn his remarks, Sanders discussed serious issues confronting the country including the 2010 Supreme Court ruling that struck down campaign finance laws. \u201cAs a result of the disastrous Supreme Court decision on Citizens United, the American political system has been totally corrupted and the foundations of American democracy are being undermined. What the Supreme Court essentially said was that it was not good enough for the billionaire class to own much of our economy. They could now own the U.S. government as well. And that is precisely what they are trying to do.\u201dSanders also addressed the planetary crisis of climate change. \u201cWhen we talk about our responsibilities as human beings and as parents, there is nothing more important than leaving this country and the entire planet in a way that is habitable for our kids and grandchildren. The debate is over. The scientific community has spoken in a virtually unanimous voice. Climate change is real. It is caused by human activity and it is already causing devastating problems in the United States and around the world.\u201dSanders said his campaign will focus on those and other substantive issues, not personal attacks or negative ads.In the few weeks since he officially formed a presidential campaign committee on April 30, Sanders has lined up more than 100,000 supporters and volunteers through BernieSanders.com. (An expanded webpage was launched on Tuesday to coincide with the campaign kickoff.) Sanders also has raised millions of dollars, mostly in small contributions of about $40 per person.After Tuesday\u2019s rally in Burlington, where Sanders served as mayor in the 1980s, he was headed on Wednesday to New Hampshire, home of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary. On Thursday, he travels to Davenport, Iowa, for the first of several stops in the Hawkeye State, which holds the first presidential caucuses. He has begun building staffs in both states to help organize what will become a nationwide grassroots campaign.", "author": "Bernie"}

Bernie Sanders this morning will declare his candidacy for president of the United States. The senator will send an email to hundreds of thousands of supporters declaring his intention to run in the Democratic Party and laying out themes of his campaign:Here are key excerpts:\u201cI am writing to inform you that I will be a candidate for President of the United States. I ask for your support.\u201cFor many months I have been traveling from coast to coast across our country, and have had the opportunity to meet with thousands of good, hard-working, and remarkable people. Like you and me, they are deeply concerned about the future of our country.\u201cThey wonder why they are working longer hours for lower wages. They worry about whether their kids will be able to afford college or get decent jobs. They fear that they may not have the savings to retire with dignity and security.\u201cThe challenges facing our country are enormous.\u201cIt\u2019s not just that, for forty years, the middle class has been disappearing. It\u2019s that 99% of all new income is going to the top 1%, and the grotesque level of wealth and income inequality today is worse than at any time since the late 1920s. The people at the top are grabbing all the new wealth and income for themselves, and the rest of America is being squeezed and left behind.\u201cThe disastrous decisions of the Supreme Court in the Citizens United case and in other related cases are undermining the very foundations of American democracy, as billionaires rig the system by using their Super PACS to buy politicians and elections.\u201cAnd the peril of global climate change, with catastrophic consequences, is the central challenge of our time and our planet.\u201cThe middle class in America is at a tipping point. It will not last another generation if we don\u2019t boldly change course now.\u201cAfter a year of travel, discussion and dialogue, I have decided to be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president. But let\u2019s be clear. This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It about a grassroots movement of Americans standing up and saying: \u2018Enough is enough. This country and our government belong to all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.", "author": "Bernie"}
